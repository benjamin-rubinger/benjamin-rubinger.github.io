            <h3>why calendar reform</h3>
            <p>there are no critical problems with the gregorian calendar, it is adequate. you can wake up every day, focus on other problems and use the gregorian calendar as it is.</p>

            <p>even so, there are a lot of opportunities to improve on the gregorian calendar, to make a calendar that is easier to learn and easier to use. lets consider how things could be better. humanity has adopted calendar reforms many times before, and you are the beneficiary of previous calendar reforms. the sooner we adopt a better calendar, the more benefits we will accrue.</p>

            <p>in the end i believe that the future will have a better calendar than the one we use today. i am curious what it will be. i have some proposals and whether you agree with my proposals or not, i welcome all improvements.</p>

            <p>the months of the gregorian calendar do not accurately match the orbit of the moon. other calendars do accurately track the motion of the moon, such as the chinese calendar.</p>

            <h4>why do we need months</h4>
            <p>it is easy to see of the phase of the moon, you can look up at the sky at the appropriate times and there it is. it doesnt take any special equipment or calculation, you just need to be able to count to 30 (that is about how many days the moons orbit takes). many calendars use a group of 12 accurate lunar months to make a lunar year. the lunar year is close to the solar year, but is several days shorter, so these calendars are not fully synchronized with the seasons, but they are easy to operate. in my opinion months are not critical to our calendar.</p>

            <p>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day">day</a> is the time it takes from one midday to the next, with sunset, midnight and sunrise in between. days are essential to human health and human activity because humans are diurnal animals, we have periods of activity and rest that match the amount of sunlight, which is what we track with the calendar unit of a day.

            <p>tracking time during a day was originally done using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial">sundials</a>. a sundial is a device that uses a fixed indicator, such as a pole, and the sun to measure the time of day. a sundial can be as simple as a stick in the ground or more complicated. the indicator casts a shadow that moves across the face of the sundial as the sun crosses the sky during the day. the indicators shadow sweeps across a half circle, a semicircle, in the direction that we call clockwise. the shadow appears at sunrise and is the longest, the shadow is the shortest at midday, then the shadow gets long again in the afternoon. the shadow disappears at sunset, when the earth blocks the light between the sun and the sundial again.</p>

            <h3>hours, minutes and seconds, and why we need them</h3>
            <p>hours, minutes and seconds are units we use to talk about time with smaller sizes than a day. a day has many hours, an hour has many minutes, and a minute has many seconds.</p>

            <p>the gregorian calendar uses 24 hours in a day with two sets of 12 hours before and after midday, 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute. times with precision higher than a second use decimal parts of a second, such as 0.5 seconds. other calendars divide days into a different numbers of hours, minutes and seconds.</p>

            <p>units smaller than a day are useful if you want to meet with someone, it helps to coordinate a precise time to meet, so you can both arrive at about the same time, instead of one of you arriving and waiting for up to a day for the other person. we can use smaller units of time to talk about shorter events like running a footrace without using the comparatively large unit of a day.</p>

            <h3>daylight saving time and why we need it</h3>
            <p>ancient civilizations organized their activities around sunlight without the use of clocks, but once we developed clocks and created rigid schedules, we found that there is a problem. if you start work at the same time each day by the clock, some parts of the year the start time is before the sun rises, too early. some parts of the year the start time is long after the sun rises, too late. one solution is to shift the calendar by one hour forward at one part of the year, then shift the calendar one hour back at another part of the year, so that the fixed working hours are better aligned with the sunlight hours. we call this biannual time shifting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">daylight saving time</a> and various regions have been practicing it since 1908 ad. most of the world does not need and does not observe daylight saving time.</p>

            <p>sundials measure local time. when the sun is highest above that sundial, that is when that sundial indicates midday. if you have another sundial located to the east or to the west, the time there is different from the time here. when your sundial indicates midday, the time on the opposite side of the earth is midnight. the time on the opposite side of the earth is half a day different from the time where you are. if we want to set everyones clocks so that the clocks chime midday when the sun is highest in the sky, then every clock would have a different time and we dont want that. we want as many clocks as possible to have the same time of day, so people can coordinate using synchronized clocks, and we want to minimize the difference between what the clock says and where the sun appears in the sky.</p>

            <p>our solution is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">time zones</a>. we created ~24 time zones, each time zone is a north-south stripe that goes from pole to pole. generally each time zone shifts the time by one hour so all clocks are less than half an hour different from solar time. one hour time zones are large enough that probably all the people you want to meet are in the same time zone with you, so you have synchronized clocks.</p>

            <p>time zones have a side effect, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Date_Line">date line</a>. midnight is the new day time in the gregorian calendar, when the current day becomes the next day. if it is midday where you are, on the opposite side of the earth it is midnight, which means that the hour of the day is not the only thing that changes between time zones, the date also changes in one timezone every hour. it is difficult enough to figure out what hour it is in another timezone, but you also sometimes have to deal with a different date. the date line is an unavoidable consequence of timezones.</p>

                <p>the earth is very close to a sphere and the earth spins on its axis about one rotation per day. the part of the earth that spins the fastest in the middle between the poles is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator">the equator</a>. everything above the equator is the half sphere called the northern hemisphere (hemisphere meaning half sphere), and everything below the equator is the southern hemisphere. there is no reason why we picked a particular direction as north, it just matters that we all agree which way we are calling north. the earth<span class="apostrophe"></span>s axis of rotation is ~23.4 degrees off of vertical relative to the sun, so as the earth revolves around the sun during a year, different parts of the earth get more and less sunlight causing the seasons. summer receives more sunlight and is hotter and winter receives less sunlight and is colder. the seasons are equal and opposite between the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere, so in the southern hemisphere it is cold when the northern hemisphere is hot, and the southern hemisphere is hot when the northern hemisphere is cold.</p>

                <h4>four seasons</h4>
                <p>we commonly describe four seasons, winter, spring, summer and fall. fall is also called autumn. seasons are especially important for farming, because plants generally cant grow in the winter due to freezing temperatures, snow cover and short sunlight hours. often seeds are planted in the spring, then the plants grow during the spring, summer and fall, then the crops are harvested in the fall. an accurate calendar that tracks the seasons is a critical tool for farmers to grow food and feed all of us. each region has different weather conditions, such as the expected day of the last frost of the winter. if a farmer plants their seeds before the last frost, then there could be another frost and the plants could be frozen and die. if the farmer plants the seeds long after the last frost, the plants may not have enough time to grow to maturity before harvest time. tracking the seasons is important for many other activities besides farming, such as any activity that occurs outside.</p>

                <h4>four seasons do not apply globally</h4>
                <p>the concept of four seasons doesnt apply globally. in the egpytian calendar there are three seasons, relating to the regular changes in the nile river, the inundataion or flood season, the emergence or winter season and the low water or summer season. locations that are close to the equator receive similar amounts of sunlight year round, and do not experience four seasons. for example, you can grow and harvest cocoa year round in equatorial regions. in tropical regions the amount of sunlight is relatively consistent, but the weather patterns shift seasonally into a rainy season and a dry season, two seasons per year. in japan there is something of a combination, with the four conventional seasons and two rainy seasons for arguably six seasons per year.</p>

                <p>the farther away from the equator, the more extreme the seasons, meaning that there is more variation in the length of sunlight hours. in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle">arctic circle</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circle">antarctic circle</a> near the axis of rotation for the earth called the poles, there are periods of continuous daytime and continuous nighttime. at the poles, there are six months of continuous daytime and six months of continuous nighttime, meaning one sunrise and one sunset per year.</p>

                <p>the longest day in a hemisphere means the most sunlight hours. the most sunlight hours would make that day the hottest day of the year, but the longest day of the year is not the hottest day of the year because of the thermal mass of the earth. this topic is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_lag">seasonal lag</a>. the air, water and rock of the earth all absorb and hold onto the heat from the sun, so the surface temperature keeps rising each day after the longest day until the sunlight hours are shorter than the rate that the earth radiates the heat and the temperature starts decreasing. seasonal lag can be up to two months between the longest day and the highest temperatures or the shortest day and lowest temperatures.</p>

            <h3>where daylight saving time is useful</h3>
            <p>calendars help people coordinate their activities based on the amount of sunlight. depending on the location, sunrise and sunset times can shift a little or a lot during a year. near the equator, sunlight hours dont change very much. at the north or the south pole, the sun rises and sets only once a year, so sunlight hours flip between 0 for half of the year and all the time for half of the year. daylight saving time has no benefit near the equator or near the poles. daylight saving time has benefits in two bands of latitudes where the daylight hours shift enough to affect a fixed schedule but not too much. that is why daylight saving time is only adopted by parts of north america, europe, south america and australia.</p>

            <p>a month is a group of days created to match the orbital period of the moon around the earth, equals one lunation, equals ~29.53 days. in order to stay synchronized with the day, months need to have a whole number of days, so calendars with accurate months will often sort of alternate between 29 and 30 days per month.</p>

            <h3>what is a day exactly</h3>
            <p>a day is the time it takes for the earth to complete slightly more than one rotation relative to the sun, also called a solar day when you want to distinguish different definitions of a day. a solar day is most easily measured from midday to midday and works out to 86400 seconds (60 seconds per minute * 60 minutes per hour * 24 hours = 86 400). why is a day slightly more than one rotation of earth? because the earth revolves 1 / ~365.2422 of the way around the sun during that day so the earth needs to rotate a little more than once for the same point to line up with the sun again. the time for exactly one rotation of earth is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time#Sidereal_day">siderial day</a> and is about four minutes shorter than a solar day. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation">earth<span class="apostrophe"></span>s rotation</a> is not a constant. the speed of earth<span class="apostrophe"></span>s rotation changes for several reasons including the moon, and is overall slowing down over time very slightly.</p>

            <p>years take ~365.2422 days and calendars are usually organized by whole days. rounding down, a year is 365 days long. the process of a leap day adds an additional day called a leap day into a year, the 366th day of that year. the process is commonly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year">leap year</a> but what leap year means is a year with a leap day in it. a year without a leap day in it is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_year">common year</a>. each year without a leap day shifts the position of the earth around the sun by about a quarter day in that calendar until we use a leap day to realign the calendar with the sun. leap days are added at the frequency that matches the fractional days in the solar year, or slightly less than once every four years. if you dont have any leap years at all, such as in the egpytian calendar, every year your calendar will shift about a quarter day, and the seasons of the calendar will slowly shift until they dont match the seasons caused by the sun. eventually the seasons will be reversed according to the calendar, and they will keep shifting until they come back to where you started making a ~1507 year cycle. if we want a solar calendar with whole days that follows the movements of the sun relative to the earth, we need to have leap days, and we need to have the right number of leap days, ~0.2422 per year.</p>

            <p>lunisolar calendars stay in sync with both the sun and the moon. you cant add a leap day to a lunisolar calendar because then the months would be out of sync with the moon. the lunar year is ~10.88 days shorter than the solar year, so after 3 lunar years the lunisolar calendar is ~32.64 days behind the earth<span class="apostrophe"></span>s orbit. instead of adding a leap day, lunisolar calendars add an entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping)#Lunisolar_calendars">leap month</a>, a 13th lunar month to the year. the frequency of leap months should be every ~2.71 lunar years (~29.53 / ~10.88 = ~2.71). an ancient greek named meton from athens observed that a 19 year cycle with a leap month added in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19 is close to the right ratio (19 / 7 = ~2.71). this cycle is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle">metonic cycle</a>, and was applied in many lunisolar calendars including the babylonian, hebrew, greek, early roman, celtic and others. the metonic cycle is so cool it was used to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_calendar">runic staffs</a> that work as lunisolar calendars to track the seasons.</p>

            <h3>conventional time, sexagesimal time</h3>
            <p>time of day is conventionally grouped into 24 hours, usually 12 hours before midday (ante meridiem, am) and 12 hours after midday (post meridiem, pm). an hour is split into 60 minutes, and a minute is split into 60 seconds. the metric system groups numbers by 10s, also called base 10, also called decimal, such as 1, 10, 100, 1000. grouping numbers by 12 is called duodecimal, and grouping numbers by 60 is called sexagesimal. so we currently use sexagesimal time.</p>

            <p>the use of the sundial and duodecimal gave us 12 daylight hours, and then doubling the daylight hours for nighttime gave us two 12 hour periods for a total of 24 hours a day. the use of sexagesimal time for minutes and seconds was introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni">al biruni</a>, an iranian scholar around the year 1000 ad.</p>

            <h3>decimal time</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time">decimal time</a> is the idea that instead of breaking up a day into groups of 12 or 60, we should break the day up by groups of 10 and then the time of day can be described by one decimal number. the simplest example is that midday should be 0.5 of a day instead of 12 pm. one way to break up the day with powers of 10 is to have 10 decimal hours, each decimal hour with 100 decimal minutes, and each decimal minute with 100 decimal seconds. if we compare sexagesimal time with decimal time, there are 86400 seconds in a sexagesimal day and 100 000 decimal seconds in a decimal day. the length of a decimal second is not the same as a sexagesimal second, but they are similar</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 decimal second = ~0.8 sexagesimal seconds</li>
                <li>1 sexagesiaml second = ~1.16 decimal seconds</li>
                <li>decimal seconds are 13.6% faster than sexagesimal seconds</li>
            </ul>
                <p>if we write out a sexagesimal time the conventional way it looks like this</p>

<pre>
10/21/2022 11:14:05 AM
           hour 11 out of 12 hours in the morning
              minute 14 out of 60 minutes per hour
                 second 5 out of 60 seconds per minute
                    before midday indicator
</pre>

            <p>in decimal time this could be written as</p>

<pre>
2022 291.46811
         hour 4 out of a 10 decimal hours per day
          minute 68 out of 100 decimal minutes per hour
            second 11 out of 100 decimal seconds per minute
</pre>
            <p>the decimal time is shorter and has a simpler structure than sexagesimal time, but it might look confusing to you because you might have never seen decimal time before. of course if you are familiar with sexagesimal time and unfamiliar with decimal time, sexagesimal time will be easy for you to understand and decimal time will be confusing for you. but that is not a fair comparison. a fair comparison is how easy or hard each system is to use if you have equal experience with each.</p>

            <p>if you dont like dealing with tiny fractions of a number, you can shift the decimal point over and write times in terms of seconds instead of days. an entire decimal day is 100 000 seconds, so the time of day i wrote above could equally be written as 46 811 seconds, no decimal point needed. no matter how you structure it, if you want to describe a time precisely then it requires several digits. if you want to describe the time less precisely you can use fewer digits, for example if you wanted to round the number of seconds to 47k.</p>

            <p>decimal time requires fewer digits in total than sexagesimal time because all the parts of the time are powers of 10. one central claim of the metric system is that using units that are all powers of 10 is easier to work with than units mixing different number bases such as 12 and 60.</p>

            <p>there are some calendars that use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnal_year">regnal eras</a>. in an era system, each consecutive ruler is defined as their own era with their own year one or year zero, and the current year is the offset from the current era. to understand a date many years in the past requires knowledge of the eras between now and the given date, you have to know how long each era was to calculate the number of years between now and the given date. eras have an advantage of usually having a small year number, eras have a disadvantage of making year numbers in different eras incomparable without detailed era knowledge.</p>

            <p>timezones help us set our clocks close to the solar time while allowing large groups of people to synchronize their clocks to make coordination easier. you dont want a timezone line to go through a large human settlement, because it is inconvenient for people in one part of town to be in a different timezone than another part of town. if you cross the timezone line many times during your day then your time will shift by one hour back and forth. any simple way of drawing the timezone lines will draw the line through the middle of a large human settlement. large human settlements avoid this problem by making deviations in the time zone line so that the entire settlement is in one time zone. this is convenient for the people in that settlement, but when every large human settlement near a time zone line does this, it causes the definition of the timezone lines to become very complex. instead of a simple rule like we have for every other part of our calendar, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone#/media/File:World_Time_Zones_Map.png">timezone map</a> is a complex political map. not only is the timezone map complex, the timezone map changes frequently. the simple idea of 24 stripes is laughable in the face of the real timezone map where timezone lines follow rivers. one notable case is the country of china which has only one time zone even though its territory extends across 5 time zone stripes. software has to use the timezone map to try to figure out what day and time it is at a given location.</p>

            <p>greenwich is a town in the southeast of london, england. greenwich has an observatory that was established in 1675 ad to use astronomy to solve the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude">determining longitude</a> when travelling at sea, commonly phrased as the question where are we now? anyone who has travelled without gps knows this feeling. britain was a naval power and had a special interest in being able to reliably navigate the oceans. several european countries including britain offered prizes for a solution to the longitude problem at that time. two solutions were found, and one of them was to use an accurate clock and some observations of the stars to determine the longitude. the greenwich observatory was then used to keep accurate time by precisely measuring midday. starting in 1833 the observatory communicated the time by dropping a large time ball down a high pole every day so that nearby ships could synchronize their clocks (called chronometers) to it.</p>

            <p>towns in england kept their own time of day before the introduction of railways. when railways were developed and needed to keep tighter timetables in 1848, the railways standardized their clocks on the greenwich time, which then became the standard time across england and nearby territories.</p>

            <p>the greenwich observatory could observe precise solar time, but real world irregularities of the motion of the earth causes the solar time to disagree with constant time by up to 16 minutes faster or slower at different parts of the year. instead of reporting the irregular solar time, the astronomers used the solar time to keep their clocks accurate and reported the average time, they call it the mean time. that is how we got <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">greenwich mean time</a>, gmt.</p>

            <p>in 1851 ships started determining their longitude in reference to the greenwich observatory, and in 1884 there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Meridian_Conference">international standardization</a> of the greenwich observatory as the reference longitude, also called the prime meridian, the definition of 0 degrees longitude. the same conference proposed that the universal day would have the new day time be midnight at greenwich mean time. in 1924 greenwich started transmitting the time via radio by the british broadcasting corporation. astronomers used midday to calibrate their clocks and had been using midday as the new day time. that was also convenient for looking at the stars at night, because all the observations overnight would be in the same calendar day. in 1928 universal time was established using gmt as the time and using midnight as the new day time. in 1955 the atomic clock was invented. atomic clocks keep amazingly consistent time. by 1960 several institutions operated their own atomic clocks and broadcast their own timing signals. the differences between the independent timing signals caused problems, so these institutions worked together to synchronize and coordinate their timing signals into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">coordinated universal time</a>. we abbreviate coordinated universal time as utc because in french it is called temps universel coordonné, tuc. you read that right. utc matches neither the english nor the french abbreviation on purpose.</p>

            <h3>24 hour time, military time</h3>
            <p>communicating datetimes is a matter of life and death in the military and several other professions such as aviation, and the common way of talking about time is error-prone. the military developed what we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Military_time">military time</a> in the united states, it uses 24 hour time instead of 12 hour time with am and pm. military time also requires all leading zeros and skips the colon separator. to be explicit, military time is not in decimal, it is still in sexagesimal, it just skips the colon separator. military time assigned letters to the timezones, the most common one is utc which was assigned the letter z. when communicating letters over a military radio there are special words for each letter, like alpha for a and bravo for b. the word for z is zulu, so utc is called zulu time in military time. examples of military time</p>

            <p>many regions have <a href="https://xkcd.com/1179/">different conventions</a> for how they write dates and times, so it is difficult to communicate dates and times across regions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">iso 8601</a> is an international standard developed to help communicate gregorian dates and times. the first version of iso 8601 was published in 1988. people usually prefer to read dates using their regional format, so iso 8601 formatted dates are usually used by the software, and then the date is reformatted to display to the customer in their regional format. iso 8601 takes the reasonable approach that datetimes should be written in the order of units from biggest to smallest, just like we write numbers. the order is year, month, day, hour, minute, second. the timezone goes last, even though it can shift the datetime by several hours and change every larger part of the date including the year! date parts are separated by dashes, and time parts are separated by colons. the hours use 24 hour time. the timezone is the hour and minute offset from utc. the standard allows you to describe less precise datetimes by skipping all the parts you dont have, so 2022 is a valid iso 8610 datetime, where the month, day, hour, minute and second are all assumed to be their minimum value such as zero. iso 8601 also accepts ordinal dates. example of a full iso 8601 formatted datetime</p>

            <h3>how did people track time before calendars or clocks</h3>
            <p>you can do well tracking time with a couple sticks of wood or a runic staff.</p>

            <p>use one stick to keep a tally. a tally is a very simple way of writing numbers by making vertical marks like |||| meaning the number 4. start counting days in your tally from when you see a new moon. after 29 or 30 days the moon should be new again, you can look up at the sky to check, and reset your tally. that is one lunar cycle. keep a second tally to count the lunar cycles. after 12 lunar cycles a lunar year has passed and you can reset the lunar cycle count. every three lunar years add a leap month to your lunar year (or use the metonic cycle) and you are effectively implementing a lunisolar calendar with a stick.</p>

            <p>put the other stick in the ground pointing up and use it as a sundial. you can make marks on the ground where sunrise, midday, and sunset shadows were the previous day and can use it to track daytime.</p>

            <h3>gregorian calendar</h3>
            <p>in 1582 ad october the catholic pope gregory xiii introduced calendar reform to the julian calendar because there were too many leap days in the julian calendar and the equinox going north in the julian calendar was out of alignment with the sun. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">gregorian calendar</a> is the same as the julian calendar with a few fixes. the gregorian calendar removed the 10 accumulated days because of the extra leap days in the julian calendar, to realign the calendar with the sun. the date jumped from 1582 10 04 to 1582 10 15. the main change in the gregorian calendar is to change the formula for leap days. in the julian calendar, leap day is every year divisible by four implying 0.25, in the gregorian calendar it is years divisible by four, except years ending with a hundred, except years ending with a hundred that are also divisible by four. this works out to 0.2425, which is much closer to ~0.2422.</p>

            <h3>french republican calendar</h3>
            <p>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar">french republican calendar</a> was introduced by the french during the french revolution along with a lot of the metric system. the calendar was used in france and french controlled regions between 1793 and 1805 until napolean became the french emperor and switched french territories back to the gregorian calendar. the french revolutionary calendar is based on the egpytian calendar, with 12 months of 30 days each and then 5 extra days to make 365 days a year. each month is arranged in 3 weeks of 10 days (3 * 10 = 30), and the days of the week are numbered, as in first, second, ... tenth.</p>

            <p>the new year day in the french republican calendar is defined as the day of the equinox going south. this calendar has leap days similar to the gregorian calendar, except the leap day is inserted before the new year day in the french republican calendar instead of the last day of february for the gregorian calendar (because march was the new year day in the roman calendar). there is dispute about exactly how leap days were handled in the french republican calendar, but the french republican calendar has leap days and it tries to match the solar year, so disputes about historical french calendar policy are not a problem here.</p>

            <p>the months of the french republican calendar are named to describe the seasonal qualities. the month names are new french words, so we could use the french names for a new calendar or translate them to english, but there is no definitive translation. the french name suffixes are thoughtfully grouped into four quarters. the french republican year and the month names start from autumn and are</p>

            <p>i think seasonal month names are lovely, except that the seasons are different on different parts of the earth, and we would like to make a calendar that works worldwide.</p>

            <h4>decimal time</h4>
            <p>the french republican calendar implemented decimal time. decimal time takes one day as a unit and breaks the day into parts based on powers of ten. instead of 24 hours in a day, in decimal time there are 10 decimal hours in a day. instead of 60 minutes per hour in sexagesimal time, in decimal time there are 100 decimal minutes per decimal hour. there are 100 decimal seconds per decimal minute. what is the problem with sexagesimal time? you have to separate the time into three parts and count them separately, hours, minutes and seconds. using decimal time, you can use a single number with a decimal point. 1 is one day. midday is halfway through the day, so in decimal time that is 0.5 days, or 5 decimal hours, or 500 decimal minutes, or 50000 decimal seconds.</p>

            <p>there is a calendar used by a lot of software called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">unix time</a>. unix time is a fairly simple calendar, it counts the number of seconds elapsed since the unix epoch. the unix epoch is the beginning of the year 1970 in the gregorian calendar, the moment of new years between 1969 and 1970. days are 86400 seconds long in unix time. times are in utc. the advantage of unix time is that a datetime is a single, whole number. if you want a unix time with subsecond precision, you can use a decimal point or multiply it by 1000 and then instead of seconds the unix time represents milliseconds. one problem with unix time is that many programmers use 32 bits to store the number, and in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem">year 2038</a> the number of seconds in unix time will overflow 32 bits.</p>

        <section id="bad epoch">
            <h3>gregorian epoch is a bad choice and is inaccurate</h3>
            <p>the current choice of epoch is supposed to match the year of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus#Other_possibly_historical_elements">birth of jesus christ</a>, but jesus was almost certainly not born in 1 bc. jesus was more likely born between 7 and 2 bc, so the current epoch is wrong even if we choose to set the epoch to the birth of jesus. we should not choose our epoch based on a religious event.
            </p>
            <h3>better choices for the epoch</h3>
            <section id="the-beginning-of-time">
                <h4>the beginning of time</h4>
                <p>the beginning of time during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">big bang</a> is the universal epoch, if we could more exactly measure when it was. the current estimate is 13.787 billion years ago with an estimated error range of 20 million years. we need higher precision with an error under a year or so to be able to use this event as an epoch without having to change it later. it is inconvenient to deal with such large year numbers all the time, for example if the current year would be 13 787 002 022 instead of 2022. every choice of epoch will eventually face the problem of very large year numbers. if the gregorian calendar persisted for 13.787 billion more years, the year number at that time in the far future would be that same large number as if we adopted the big bang as the epoch now.</p>

                <h4>formation of the earth</h4>
                <p>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Formation">formation of the earth</a> is a great epoch choice for an earth calendar based on earth years, because earth years only make sense as a concept once the earth exists. the current estimate of the formation of the earth is 4.54 billion years ago, with an error range of 40 million years. that value isnt precise enough to base an epoch on, and the value is too large to write all the time. another problem is that the formation of the earth is a continuous process that doesnt have a bright line that allows us to identify a moment, or in this case a year, when the earth comes into existence.</p>

                </ul>
                <p>there are many momentous occasions that we could use as an epoch, but they occurred very long in the past and we dont have precise dates for them to base our calendar epoch on.</p>

                <p>we could make use of approximate dates and arbitrarily choose a date within the range as our epoch. this approach has been proposed several times with the holocene era, referring to the neolithic revolution, the approximate year when humans started switching from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to farming. this transition is arguably the beginning of human civilization and marks the single occasion when calendars became important. the neolithic revolution is recent enough that we have physical evidence and can estimate when it occurred. the current estimate is 11 700 years ago. the estimate is approximate, and improved evidence or analysis can and has changed the estimated date of the neolithic revolution.</p>

                <p>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar">holocene calendar</a> proposes to subtract 10 000 years from our current epoch, effectively adding a leading 1 to our current year, so 2022 becomes 12022. this epoch may not be exactly the beginning of the neolithic revolution, but the idea is that practically all recorded history will fall after that date.</p>

                <p>some of the problems with this proposal is that the year is not precise, the exact year number is still based on the gregorian epoch, the year number is one digit longer, and future analysis might make this epoch more inaccurate.</p>

            <section id="julian-day-epoch">
                <h4>julian day epoch</h4>
                <p>4713 bc is the epoch for the julian day calendar. the particular year was derived based on cycles of the gregorian calendar and roman tax collection, so the derivation is not very meaningful today. it is an arbitrary yet specific date that is before written history and has been in use as an epoch for hundreds of years, primarily by astronomers.</p>

            <section id="oldest-recorded-date">
                <h4>oldest recorded date</h4>
                <p>there are some written accounts that describe a solar eclipse or another detail that we can back calculate to a specific datetime. we could choose the earliest of those recorded historical events and make that the epoch. according to that approach however, if archeology discovers a document with an earlier verifiable date, we would need to change the epoch again. we want a stable epoch. it is good to celebrate a human event, but the choice of any particular human event seems to be random and overly specific.</p>

            <section id="unix-epoch">
                <h4>unix epoch</h4>
                <p>unix time uses an epoch of 1970-01-01. a lot of people living today were born after 1970, so many of the events that we talk about would be after the epoch. it is easier to talk about dates after the epoch. if we chose an epoch after 1970, more and more dates that we commonly discuss would be before the epoch and that is more difficult for people to deal with than keeping dates in common conversation after the epoch. the anno domini epoch was established long after the life of jesus, so people could use the new epoch to talk about dates in the recent past without crossing the epoch.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="now">
                <h4>now</h4>
                <p>we could declare that the epoch is when we choose to adopt the new calendar. that is a solipsistic choice, but if the choice of epoch is arbitrary then it also cant be wrong, which is better than choosing an event that is supposed to be important but becomes unimportant. recontextualizing history to before and after the adoption of a calendar really elevates the importance of the calendar above where the importance of a calendar should be, but we have to elevate something as the epoch. as we see with the anno domini system, elevating any particular person or event can eventually become a problem for a calendar when that person or event loses relevance.</p>

        <section id="missing-0-ad">
            <h3>missing year zero in anno domini</h3>
            <p>how many years are there between 5 bc and 5 ad? it ought to be 10, but the answer is 9. the epoch of the gregorian calendar isnt year zero. in the gregorian calendar there is no year zero, the calendar goes from 1 bc to 1 ad and skips zero. this is why during the celebrations of the year 2000, there were some people pointing out that it was actually the 1999th year since the epoch. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini">anno domini</a> system of counting is incorrect, there should be a year zero and then the number of years between dates before and after the epoch would be simple to calculate.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="bc-and-ad">
            <h3>bc and ad</h3>
            <p>before christ for bc, and in the year of our lord jesus christ, anno domini for ad, are appropriate for a christian calendar. when we choose a different epoch we should choose a different way to designate dates before and after the new epoch. some people avoid christian religious terms by replacing bc with before the common era bce, and ad with the common era ce. these are non religious terms but also vague as names. bce and ce are currently defined equivalently to bc and ad, so we should intentionally choose different names for before and after a new epoch to avoid calendar confusion.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="choice-of-the-new-year-day">
            <h3>choice of the new year day</h3>
            <p>the current day of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Day">new year</a> in the gregorian calendar, january 1, was the new year day in the roman calendar even before the julian calendar, however many areas in the roman empire observed different new year days and other parts of the world chose other new year days too. most of europe started standardizing the new year day to be january 1 in the mid to late 1500s with some exceptions. the choice of new year day on january 1 is supposed to be the day of the southern solstice, but it is inaccurate. if we want to select the southern solstice for the new year day, we should match the calendar with the solstice, not be persistently wrong. the southern solstice is not the best choice because it is the shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere but the longest day of the year in the southern hemisphere, so it is opposite in significance between the northern and southern hemispheres. we should start the year from one of the equinoxes instead, such as the equinox going south, and we should use the correct day of the equinox.</p>

        <section id="month-names">
            <h3>month names</h3>
            <p>if a month name includes the month number, the number in the name should match the number of the month. for example, if we want to name a month december then it must be the tenth month, not the twelfth. month names should also not be religious, long or hard to spell. for example the month name of february is religious (referring to a ritual of purification), long and hard to spell. i suggest that we should use plain month numbers instead of names.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="month-length">
            <h3>month length</h3>
            <p>the lunar period is ~29.53 days, so the correct number of days in a month is either 29 or 30. 31 days in the month of january or 28 days in the month of february are incorrect. a solar calendar such as the gregorian calendar should not have months. we should use ordinal days, count year days from 0 to 364 instead. if we want to have months in our calendar then the months should accurately follow the moon, such as in a lunisolar calendar.</p>

        <section id="weekday-names">
            <h3>weekday names</h3>
            <p>if we have weeks then we need to designate the days of the week. if we name the weekdays, the names should not be religious, long, or hard to spell. for example, wednesday refers to the god odin, is long and hard to spell. we should not have weeks in the calendar, but if we do then we should number the days of the week.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="weekday-next">
            <h3>the weekday next problem</h3>
            <p>imagine the current day of the week is thursday and someone invites you to an event next saturday. is the event 2 days or 9 days from today? the ambiguity comes from an implicit phrase after what they said. the event could be on the next saturday (after today), or it could be on the next saturday (after this saturday). some english speakers use the form saturday week to mean the 9 days from today option. i think the solution if we want to use weekdays is to avoid phrases like next saturday. if the event is in two days then it is saturday, or this week saturday, or this saturday. if the event is in 9 days then it is next week saturday. using weeks causes some confusion, so giving a date is the most reliable solution.</p>

            <h3>duodecimal and sexagesimal time</h3>
            <p>when we break a day into hours, the number of hours should be a power of 10, such as 10 or 100, not 24. the 24 hours in a day came from the egyptians. when we break an hour into minutes, it should be 10, 100, or 1000, not 60. the metric system is convenient and promotes decimal units, powers of ten. we should use decimal time.</p>

            <h3>date format ordering</h3>
            <p>month/day/year, day/month/year, year/month/day and other date formats are in common use. the correct way to write dates is how you write any other number, from the most significant part to the least significant part. every other ordering is worse. datetime order should be year month day hour minute second subsecond.

        <section id="date-format-delimiters">
            <h3>date format delimiters</h3>
            <p>writing a datetime as a single decimal number is the best option. if we want to keep years, months and days in our calendar, those cannot fit into a single number, so we could write them separately as we do now. the common way of writing dates uses slashes as delimiters, mm/dd/yy or dd/mm/yy. iso 8601 prefers dashes, yyyy-mm-dd. when it comes to delimiters, i recommend against any special symbols and prefer to use space as the delimiter, yyyy mm dd.</p>

            <h3>time format delimiters</h3>
            <p>in sexagesimal time (60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute), the use of colons in time parts is the current standard, hh:mm:ss.sss. when it comes to delimiters, i recommend against any special symbols and prefer to use space as the delimiter, hh mm ss.sss.</p>

            <h3>noon</h3>
            <p>the term midnight makes sense, midnight marks the middle of the night. the opposite of midnight is the special word noon. i suggest that we should use the more consistent word midday.</p>

        <section id="12-hour-time">
            <h3>12 hour time with am and pm</h3>
            <p>if someone schedules to meet with you at 8, is that 8 am or 8 pm? it is often possible to infer whether the time is am or pm from context and experience, but misunderstandings do occur. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock">12 hour time</a> requires additional information with the am or pm suffix. the time of the day before midday is written with a suffix am, am stands for ante meridiem meaning before midday. the time of day after midday is written with a suffix pm, pm stands for post meridiem.</p>

            <p>am and pm are not only needlessly complicated, am and pm are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Confusion_at_noon_and_midnight">confusing</a> when applied to midday and midnight. midday is neither before itself nor after itself, so neither am nor pm is accurate when applied to midday. some people propose to write midday as 12 m instead, but this is not common practice. midnight is the new day time and straddles the end of one day and the beginning of the next. you could equally describe midnight as after the previous midday, pm, or before the next midday, am. the convention in 12 hour time is to call midnight 12 am and midday 12 pm.</p>

            <p>this is additionally confusing because 12 is the largest hour number in 12 hour time. 12 being the largest number suggests that it is the latest time, so 12 am is intuitively what comes after 11 am. according to convention, however, after 11 am comes 12 pm. this would be easier to understand in 12 hour time if we instead numbered hours from 0 to 11. 0 am numerically refers to the beginning of the morning, followed by 1 am. 0 pm numerically refers to the beginning of the afternoon, followed by 1 pm. 11 am is the end of the morning and is followed by midday, which marks the beginning of the afternoon, 0 pm. 11 pm is the last hour of the day, followed by 0 am to start the next day.</p>

            <p>i claim that 12 hour time is needlessly complex and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock">24 hour time</a>, also called military time, is strictly better. in the case of metric time, that will be 10 hour time, not 5 hour time with am and pm. in 24 hour time, the hours go from 00 to 23. 2400 can optionally be used to emphasize midnight as the end of a day, it is equivalent to 0000 of the next day.</p>

        <section id="timezone-first">
            <h3>iso 8601 should put the timezone first</h3>
            <p>the timezone can shift the time forward or backward by several hours, which can shift every larger part of the datetime including the year. the purpose of ordering the units in the datetime from largest to smallest is to match lexicographic ordering with chronological ordering. times are only commensurate and ordered within the same time zone, so the timezone should be the most major component, not the least major. if you dislike sorting separating by timezone, you should dislike even more the sort order being wrong because of the timezones. if you want the lexicographic order to be chronological, i think we have to limit the datetime format to use only one timezone, such as utc. i also advocate eliminating timezones entirely.</p>

            <h3>end daylight saving time</h3>
            <p>daylight saving time is a bad solution to a real problem. people living close to the poles and people living close to the equator have no benefit from daylight saving time. changing the calendar to accommodate a rigid schedule is much more confusing than keeping the calendar consistent and changing work schedules to match daylight hours. working based on shifting sunrise and sunset was what people did before mechanical clocks and rigid schedules. daylight saving time was likely a good solution when life was regionally focused and communication was expensive, but now people move and interact worldwide and communication is cheap. most of the world does not currently observe daylight saving time. only parts of the united states, canada, europe, south america, australia, new zealand, and a few others observe daylight saving time. keep the calendar simple. end daylight saving time.</p>

            <p><!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time#/media/File:Greenwich_clock.jpg-->time is fundamentally linear. when we make a diagram to show when events happen, we show the events on a straight line called a timeline, not on a circle. when we want to show progression, we use a progress bar. <progress value="0" max="100" class="circular"></progress> so why are clocks circular? clocks are circular because we care about sunlight. we are not using clocks to track time, we are using clocks to track the location of the sun. clocks are mechanized versions of the sundial. on a sundial the shadow sweeps across a semicircle in a particular direction, the direction we call clockwise.</p>

            <p>timezones are a compromise that allow regions to synchronize their clocks while allowing everyone globally to have their hour hands point up at approximately midday. the costs of timezones today are significant. if you travel or communicate across timezones, the local time changes, and you have to calculate what the time difference will be. people often forget to make this calculation or get the calculation wrong.</p>
            <p>timezones massively complicate international events. if a company offers a worldwide promotion starting on a date in the local time of the customers, the promotion becomes active in one timezone per hour over the course of a day which is complex to manage. if instead the company offers the worldwide promotion starting on a date in the local time of the company headquarters, then the customers need to calculate when the promotion starts for them, which might be during any time of the day or night.</p>
            <p>timezones were beneficial when people lived and operated within one timezone. it is now more common to communicate and travel worldwide, so the benefits of timezones are reduced and the costs are increased. we should eliminate timezones.</p>
            <p>if we eliminate timezones, then everyones clocks will be synchronized. travelling and communicating worldwide will be simplified - if i fly from here to there over four hours, the time there when i arrive there will be four hours later, as you would like. if i schedule to call you tomorrow at 10, that is the same time for you and me, no matter where you are relative to me.</p>

            <p>of course, there are problems with eliminating timezones. some of these problems are solvable. for example, if we eliminate timezones then the hour hand on your clock will only point in the direction of the sun if you are on the prime meridian. everywhere else the hour hand will be synchronized with the sun but not point in the direction of the sun.</p>

            <p>the solution is to rotate your clock face. the time of day is the same, but the clock face can rotate to match the direction of the sun.</p>
            <p>when we talk to someone far away from us today, using timezones, we commonly ask what time is it over there? if we eliminate timezones, the time there will always be the same as the time here, we will have universal time. the question people might ask instead is what time is convenient for you?</p>

            <h3>no year limit</h3>
            <p>if a calendar operates for a long time, the year will become longer and longer to write, eventually passing 10 000, 100 000, 1 million and more. almost all dates in an old calendar will have long year numbers. i propose 10 000 year eras so year numbers are always four digits or fewer, except when you refer to previous or future eras. for example, if we write out a date in the far future from now such as the year 41 032, we could instead write it as era 4 1032, and write it as 1032 when the era is already established. whenever you omit information there is the possibility of ambiguity, so there must be additional work to provide consistent context to allow us to write short year numbers even in old calendars.

            <h3>one indexing is wrong, zero indexing is right</h3>
            <p>the hours of the day shouldnt be 1 - 12, they should be 0 - 11 (12 hour time), 0 - 23 (24 hour time) or 0 - 9 (decimal time). months shouldnt be 1 - 12, they should be 0 - 11. day numbers of the week, month or year should start from zero. the epoch starts from zero, military time starts from zero, everything should start from zero.</p>

            <h3>use a single number for datetimes</h3>
            <p>julian days use a single number with the unit of a day. unix time uses a single number with the unit of a second or a millisecond. another option is to use a single number with the unit of a year. a metric year could be initially defined to match a tropical earth year. the year could be split into 10 months that have nothing to do with the moon, so maybe we could call them something different. for example, halfway through the current year would be 2022.5.</p>

            <p>use ordinal dates and decimal time. it is a two number datetime format, with one number for the year and the other number for the day in the current year and the fraction of the day. these two numbers provide the three fundamental purposes of a calendar, to locate points in time, track the seasons and the position of the sun in the sky.</p>
