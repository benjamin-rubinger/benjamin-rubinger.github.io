            <h3>why we need calendars</h3>
            <p>humans need a calendar for many reasons, but two of the most important reasons are</p>
            <ul>
                <li>humans are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnality">diurnal</a> animals that have regular periods of activity and rest (days)</li>
                <li>we need to track the seasons to be able to grow food to survive (years)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>in general calendars help with many human challenges.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>reliably measure and communicate how long something takes</li>
                <li>set a timer to wake up at a particular time</li>
                <li>use a date to talk about events in the past or the future</li>
                <li>coordinate to meet at a specific time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>overall we use calendars to analyze, predict, plan and organize our activities by time. calendars are fundamental to modern daily life.</p>
            <p>many different calendars are capable of meeting our needs. when you learn about multiple calendars, you can compare them. you can decide which calendar is</p>
            <ul>
                <li>easier to use</li>
                <li>more accurate</li>
                <li>easier to learn</li>

        <section id="the-motions-of-the-earth">
            <h3>the motions of the earth</h3>
            <p>humans generally live on a mostly spherical planet called earth which rotates and revolves relative to the sun. these motions of the earth are the reason why humans need a calendar.</p>

            <p>rotation is similar to turning your head when you are standing near a light, the earths rotation causes sunlight to periodically hit every part of earths surface. half of the time a location on earths surface has sunlight (daytime) and half of the time a location gets less sunlight because the earth blocks the sun (nighttime). humans care about sunlight because we have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm">circadian rhythm</a>, a cycle of activity and rest that matches the cycle of visible sunlight.</p>

            <p>the earth revolves around the sun, also called its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit">orbit</a>, the earth goes around the sun in pretty much a circle, even though the orbit is technically an ellipse.</p>

            <p>the rotation of the earth is not perpendicular to the sun, it is tilted, the earths axis of rotation is ~23.4 degrees off of vertical. the combination of the earths orbit and the tilt of its axis of rotation changes the amount of sunlight that hits parts of the earth at different parts of the orbit, and this causes the seasons. seasons are changes to the weather, including higher and lower temperatures, and more and less rain. humans care about seasons. one reason to care about the seasons is that most of the food that we eat can only grow during specific seasons. if we do not correctly track the seasons then we can fail to grow food and starve. our current calendars work fine, so we will not starve because of our current calendars.</p>

        <section id="what-calendar-do-we-use">
            <h3>what calendar do we currently use</h3>
            <p>the calendar in most common use today is a religious christian calendar called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">gregorian calendar</a>, introduced in 1582 ad october by the catholic pope gregory xiii. there are lots of other calendars besides the gregorian calendar, many of them in popular use. other calendars i will describe include the egyptian calendar, the chinese calendar, the islamic calendar, the hebrew calendar, the roman calendar, the julian calendar, the french revolutionary calendar, julian days, unix time, and star treks stardates.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="why-calendar-reform">
            <h3>why we should do calendar reform</h3>
            <p>there are no critical problems with the gregorian calendar, it is adequate. you can wake up every day, focus on other problems and use the gregorian calendar as-is.</p>

            <p>even so, there are a lot of opportunities to improve on the gregorian calendar, to make a calendar that is easier to learn and easier to use. lets consider how things could be better. humanity has adopted calendar reforms many times before, and you are the beneficiary of previous calendar reforms. the sooner we adopt a better calendar, the more benefits we will accrue.</p>

            <p>in the end i believe that the future will have a better calendar than the one we use today. i am curious what it will be. i have some suggestions and whether you agree with them or not, i welcome all improvements.</p>

            <h3>years and why we need them</h3>
            <p>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year">year</a> is the time it takes for earth to cycle through all of the seasons and for the sun to return to the same place in the sky. we care about years because accurate years track the seasons, and seasons affect all of our outdoor activities, for example farming, which we need to survive.</p>

        <section id="epoch">
            <h3>epoch</h3>
            <p>when we count anything, including years, we need to start from somewhere. the starting year of a calendar, which should be year 0, is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch">epoch</a>. in the gregorian calendar the epoch is 1 bc, 2022 years ago at the time of writing. we could choose a different epoch, a different year 0, for example we could choose the year 1970 ad instead. then the current year would be 52 because 2022 is 52 years after 1970.</p>

        <section id="new-year-day">
            <h3>new year day</h3>
            <p>we must choose when one year ends and the next year begins. in the gregorian calendar the new year day is january 1. in the roman calendar, for example, the new year day was march 1.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="months-and-why">
            <h3>months and why we need them</h3>
            <p>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Month">month</a> is a group of days that matches the length of the orbit of the moon around the earth, often measured from new moon to new moon. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase">phases of the moon</a> are</p>
            <ul>
                <li>new (the entire moon is dark)</li>
                <li>waxing crescent</li>
                <li>first quarter (the moon is half bright, half dark)</li>
                <li>waxing gibbous</li>
                <li>full (the entire moon is bright)</li>
                <li>waning gibbous</li>
                <li>last quarter (the moon is half dark, half bright)</li>
                <li>waning crescent</li>
                <li>new (the cycle repeats)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>the gregorian calendar has 12 months named (in english)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>january</li>
                <li>february</li>
                <li>march</li>
                <li>april</li>
                <li>may</li>
                <li>june</li>
                <li>july</li>
                <li>august</li>
                <li>september</li>
                <li>october</li>
                <li>november</li>
                <li>december</li>
            </ul>
            <p>the months of the gregorian calendar do not accurately match the orbit of the moon. other calendars do accurately track the motion of the moon, such as the chinese calendar.</p>

            <h4>why do we need months</h4>
            <p>it is easy to see of the phase of the moon, you can look up at the sky at the appropriate times and there it is. it doesnt take any special equipment or calculation, you just need to be able to count to 30 (that is about how many days the moons orbit takes). many calendars use a group of 12 accurate lunar months to make a lunar year. the lunar year is close to the solar year, but is several days short, so these calendars can not stay synchronized with the seasons, but they are easy to operate. in my opinion months are not critical to our calendar.</p>

            <h3>days and why we need them</h3>
            <p>a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day">day</a> is the time it takes from one noon to the next, with sunset, midnight and sunrise in between. days are essential to human health and human activity because humans are diurnal animals, we have periods of activity and rest that match the amount of sunlight, which is what we track with the calendar unit of a day.

            <p>tracking time during a day was originally done using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundial">sundials</a>. a sundial is a simple object that has a fixed indicator, such as a pole. a sundial can be as simple as a stick in the ground. the indicator casts a shadow that moves across the face of the sundial as the sun crosses the sky during the day. the indicators shadow sweeps across a half circle, a semicircle, in the direction that we call clockwise. the shadow appears at sunrise and is the longest, the shadow is the shortest at midday, then the shadow gets long again in the afternoon. the shadow disappears at sunset, when the earth blocks the light between the sun and the sundial again.</p>

            <h3>hours, minutes and seconds, and why we need them</h3>
            <p>hours, minutes and seconds are units we use to talk about time with smaller sizes than a day. a day has many hours, an hour has many minutes, and a minute has many seconds.</p>

            <p>the gregorian calendar uses 24 hours in a day with two sets of 12 hours before and after noon, 60 minutes per hour and 60 seconds per minute. times with precision higher than a second use decimal parts of a second. some other calendars divide days into a different numbers of hours, minutes and seconds.</p>

            <p>units smaller than a day are useful if you want to meet with someone, it helps to coordinate a precise time to meet so you can both arrive at about the same time, instead of one of you arriving and waiting for up to a day for the other person. we can use smaller units of time to talk about shorter events like running a footrace without using the comparatively large unit of a day.</p>

        <section id="daylight-savings-time-and-why">
            <h3>daylight savings time and why we need it</h3>
            <p>ancient civilizations organized their activities around sunlight without the use of clocks, but once we developed clocks and created a rigid schedule, we found that there is a problem. if you start work at the same time each day by the clock, some parts of the year the start time is before the sun rises, too early. some parts of the year the start time is long after the sun rises, too late. one solution is to shift the calendar by one hour forward at one part of the year, then shift the calendar one hour back at another part of the year, so that the fixed working hours are better aligned with the sunlight hours. we call this biannual time shifting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">daylight savings time</a> and various regions have been practicing it since 1908 ad. most of the world does not need and does not observe daylight savings time.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="timezones-and-why">
            <h3>timezones and why we need them</h3>
            <p>sundials measure local time. when the sun is highest above that sundial, that is when that sundial indicates noon. if you have a second sundial located to the east or to the west, the time there is different from the time here. when your sundial indicates noon, the time on the opposite side of the earth is midnight. the time on the opposite side of the earth is 12 hours different from the time where you are. if we want to set everyones clocks so that the clocks chime noon when the sun is highest in the sky, then everyone would have a different time and we dont want that. we want as many people as possible to have the same time of day, so they can coordinate using synchronized clocks, and we want to minimize the difference between what the clock says and where the sun appears in the sky. our solution is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">time zones</a>. we created ~24 time zones, each zone is a stripe that goes from the north pole to the south pole. generally each time zone shifts the time by one hour so nobody will have a clock that is more than half an hour different from solar time. one hour time zones are large enough that probably all the people you want to meet are in the same time zone with you so you have synchronized clocks.</p>

        <section id="international-date-line-and-why">
            <h3>international date line and why we need it</h3>
            <p>time zones have a side effect, which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Date_Line">date line</a>. midnight is the new day time, when the current day becomes the next day. if it is noon where you are, on the opposite side of the earth it is midnight, which means that the hour of the day is not the only thing that changes between time zones, the date also changes in one timezone every hour. it is difficult enough to figure out what hour it is in another timezone, but you also sometimes have to deal with a different date. the date line is an unavoidable consequence of timezones.</p>

                <p>the earth is very close to a sphere and the earth spins on its axis about one rotation per day. the part of the earth that spins the fastest in the middle between the poles is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator">the equator</a>. everything above the equator is the half sphere called the northern hemisphere (hemisphere meaning half sphere), and everything below the equator is the southern hemisphere. there is no reason why we picked a particular direction as north, it just matters that we all agree which way we are calling north. the earths axis of rotation is ~23.4 degrees off of vertical relative to the sun, so as the earth revolves around the sun during a year, different parts of the earth get more and less sunlight causing the seasons. summer receives more sunlight and is hotter and winter receives less sunlight and is colder. the seasons are equal and opposite between the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere, so in the southern hemisphere it is cold when the northern hemisphere is hot, and the southern hemisphere is hot when the northern hemisphere is cold.</p>

                <h4>four seasons</h4>
                <p>we commonly describe four seasons, winter, spring, summer and fall. fall is also called autumn. seasons are especially important for farming, because plants generally cant grow in the winter due to freezing temperatures, snow cover and short sunlight hours. often seeds are planted in the spring, then the plants grow during the spring, summer and fall, then the crops are harvested in the fall. an accurate calendar that tracks the seasons is a critical tool for farmers to grow food and feed all of us. each region has different weather conditions, such as the expected day of the last frost of the winter. if a farmer plants their seeds before the last frost, then there could be another frost and the plants could be frozen and die. if the farmer plants the seeds long after the last frost, the plants may not have enough time to grow to maturity before harvest time. tracking the seasons is important for many other activities besides farming, such as any activity that occurs outside.</p>

                <h4>four seasons do not apply globally</h4>
                <p>the concept of four seasons doesnt apply globally. in the egpytian calendar there are three seasons, relating to the regular changes in the nile river, the inundataion or flood season, the emergence or winter season and the low water or summer season. locations that are close to the equator receive similar amounts of sunlight year round, and do not experience four seasons. for example, you can grow and harvest cocoa year round in equatorial regions. in tropical regions the amount of sunlight is relatively consistent, but the weather patterns shift seasonally into a rainy season and a dry season, two seasons per year. in japan there is something of a combination, with the four conventional seasons and two rainy seasons for arguably six seasons per year.</p>

                <p>the farther away from the equator, the more extreme the seasons, meaning that there is more variation in the length of sunlight hours. in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle">arctic circle</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circle">antarctic circle</a> near the axis of rotation for the earth called the poles, there are periods of continuous daytime and continuous nighttime. at the poles, there are six months of continuous daytime and six months of continuous nighttime, meaning one sunrise and one sunset per year.</p>

                <p>there is always a point on the surface of the earth that is closest to the sun, that point moves north and south over a year, back and forth. the moment when that point crosses the equator is called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox">equinox</a>. a day on the equator during an equinox has 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of night. there are two equinoxes per year, one when the sun crosses the equator going from the south to the north, and the other when the sun crosses the equator going from north to south. after each equinox, the sun continues in that direction until it reaches its most extreme point of the year in the north or the south, that is called a solstice and will be the longest or shortest day of the year in each hemisphere. so over a year there will be four events</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_solstice">southern solstice</a> (longest day of the year in the south, shortest day of the year in the north)</li>

                <p>the longest day in a hemisphere means the most sunlight hours. the most sunlight hours would make that day the hottest day of the year, but the longest day of the year is not the hottest day of the year because of the thermal mass of the earth. this topic is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_lag">seasonal lag</a>. the air, water and rock of the earth all absorb and hold onto the heat from the sun, so the surface temperature keeps rising each day after the longest day until the sunlight hours are shorter than the rate that the earth radiates the heat and the temperature starts decreasing. seasonal lag can be up to two months between the longest day and the highest temperatures or the shortest day and lowest temperatures.</p>

            <h3>where daylight savings time is useful</h3>
            <p>calendars help people coordinate their activities based on the amount of sunlight. depending on the location, sunrise and sunset times can shift a little or a lot during a year. near the equator, sunlight hours dont change very much. at the north or the south pole, the sun rises and sets only once a year, so sunlight hours flip between 0 for half of the year and all of the time for half of the year. daylight savings time has no benefit near the equator or near the poles. daylight savings time has benefits in two bands of latitudes where the daylight hours shift enough to affect a fixed schedule but not too much. that is why daylight savings time is only adopted by parts of north america, europe, south america and australia.</p>

            <p>a day the time it takes for the earth to complete slightly more than one rotation relative to the sun, also called a solar day when you want to distinguish different definitions of a day. a solar day is most easily measured from noon to noon and works out to 86400 seconds (60 seconds per minute * 60 minutes per hour * 24 hours = 86 400). why is a day slightly more than one rotation of earth? because the earth revolves 1 / ~365.2422 of the way around the sun during that day so the earth needs to rotate a little more than once for the same point to line up with the sun again. the time for exactly one rotation of earth is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time#Sidereal_day">siderial day</a> and is about four minutes shorter than a solar day. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation">earths rotation</a> is not a constant. the speed of earths rotation changes for several reasons including the moon, and is overall slowing down over time very slightly.</p>

            <p>years take ~365.2422 days and calendars are usually organized by whole days. rounding down, a year is 365 days long. the process of a leap day adds an additional day called a leap day into a year, the 366th day of that year. the process is commonly called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year">leap year</a> but what leap year means is a year with a leap day in it. a year without a leap day in it is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_year">common year</a>. each year without a leap day shifts the position of the earth around the sun by about a quarter day in that calendar until we use a leap day to realign the calendar with the sun. leap days are added at the frequency that matches the fractional days in the solar year, or slightly less than once every four years. if you dont have any leap years at all, such as in the egpytian calendar, every year your calendar will shift about a quarter day, and the seasons of the calendar will slowly shift until they dont match the seasons caused by the sun. eventually the seasons will be reversed according to the calendar, and they will keep shifting until they come back to where you started making a ~1507 year cycle. if we want a solar calendar with whole days that follows the movements of the sun relative to the earth, we need to have leap days, and we need to have the right number of leap days, ~0.2422 per year.</p>

            <p>lunisolar calendars stay in sync with both the sun and the moon. you cant add a leap day to a lunisolar calendar because then the months would be out of sync with the moon. the lunar year is ~10.88 days shorter than the solar year, so after 3 lunar years the lunisolar calendar is ~32.64 days behind the earths orbit. instead of adding a leap day, lunisolar calendars add an entire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping)#Lunisolar_calendars">leap month</a>, a 13th lunar month to the year. the frequency of leap months should be every ~2.71 lunar years (~29.53 / ~10.88 = ~2.71). an ancient greek named meton from athens observed that a 19 year cycle with a leap month added in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 19 is close to the right ratio (19 / 7 = ~2.71). this cycle is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonic_cycle">metonic cycle</a>, and was applied in many lunisolar calendars including the babylonian, hebrew, greek, early roman, celtic and others. the metonic cycle is so cool it was used to create runic staffs that work as lunisolar calendars to track the seasons.</p>

            <p>time of day is conventionally grouped into 24 hours, usually 12 hours before noon (ante meridiem, am) and 12 hours after noon (post meridiem, pm). an hour is split into 60 minutes, and a minute is split into 60 seconds. the metric system groups numbers by 10s, also called base 10, also called decimal, such as 1, 10, 100, 1000. grouping numbers by 12 is called duodecimal, and grouping numbers by 60 is called sexagesimal. so we currently use sexagesimal time.</p>

            <p>the use of the sundial and duodecimal gave us 12 daylight hours, and then doubling the daylight hours for nighttime gave us two 12 hour periods for a total of 24 hours a day. the use of sexagesimal time for minutes and seconds was introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni">al biruni</a>, an iranian scholar around the year 1000 ad.</p>

            <h3>decimal time</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time">decimal time</a> is the idea that instead of breaking up a day into groups of 12 or 60, we should break the day up by groups of 10 and then the time of day can be described by one decimal number. the simplest example is that midday should be 0.5 of a day instead of 12 pm. one way to break up the day with powers of 10 is to have 10 decimal hours, each decimal hour with 100 decimal minutes, and each decimal minute with 100 decimal seconds. if we compare sexagesimal time with decimal time, there are 86400 seconds in a sexagesimal day and 100 000 decimal seconds in a decimal day. the length of a decimal second is not the same as a sexagesimal second, but they are similar</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 decimal second = ~0.8 sexagesimal seconds</li>
                <li>1 sexagesiaml second = ~1.16 decimal seconds</li>
                <li>decimal seconds are 13.6% faster than sexagesimal seconds</li>
            </ul>
                <p>if we write out a sexagesimal time the conventional way it looks like this</p>

<pre>
10/21/2022 11:14:05 AM
           hour 11 out of 12 hours in the morning
              minute 14 out of 60 minutes per hour
                 second 5 out of 60 seconds per minute
                    before noon indicator
</pre>

            <p>in decimal time this could be written as</p>

<pre>
2022 291.46811
         hour 4 out of a 10 decimal hours per day
          minute 68 out of 100 decimal minutes per hour
            second 11 out of 100 decimal seconds per minute
</pre>
            <p>the decimal time is shorter and has a simpler structure than sexagesimal time, but it might look confusing to you because you might have never seen decimal time before. of course if you are familiar with sexagesimal time and unfamiliar with decimal time, sexagesimal time will be easy for you to understand and decimal time will be confusing for you. but that is not a fair comparison. a fair comparison is how easy or hard each system is to use if you have equal experience with each.</p>

            <p>if you dont like dealing with tiny fractions of a number, you can shift the decimal point over and write times in terms of seconds instead of days. an entire decimal day is 100 000 seconds, so the time of day i wrote above could equally be written as 46 811 seconds, no decimal point needed. no matter how you structure it, if you want to describe a time precisely then it requires several digits. if you want to describe the time less precisely you can use fewer digits, for example if you wanted to round the number of seconds to 47k.</p>

            <p>decimal time requires fewer digits in total than sexagesimal time because all the parts of the time are powers of 10. one central claim of the metric system is that using units that are all powers of 10 is easier to work with than units mixing different number bases such as 12 and 60.</p>

            <p>timezones help us set our clocks close to the solar time while allowing large groups of people to synchronize their clocks to make coordination easier. you dont want a timezone line to go through a large human settlement, because it is inconvenient for people in one part of town to be in a different timezone than another part of town. if you cross the timezone line many times during your day then your time will shift by one hour back and forth. any simple way of drawing the timezone lines will draw the line through the middle of a large human settlement. large human settlements avoid this problem by making deviations in the time zone line so that the entire settlement is in one time zone. this is convenient for the people in that settlement, but when every large human settlement near a time zone line does this, it causes the definition of the timezone lines to become very complex. instead of a simple rule like we have for every other part of our calendar, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone#/media/File:World_Time_Zones_Map.png">timezone map</a> is a complex political map. not only is the timezone map complex, the timezone map changes frequently. the simple idea of 24 stripes is laughable in the face of the real timezone map where timezone lines follow rivers. one notable case is the country of china which has only one time zone even though its territory extends across 5 time zone stripes. software has to use the timezone map to try to figure out what day and time it is at a given location.</p>

            <h3>greenwich mean time, gmt, coordinated universal time, utc</h3>
            <p>greenwich is a town in the southeast of london, england. greenwich has an observatory that was established in 1675 ad to use astronomy to solve the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude">determining longitude</a> when travelling at sea, commonly phrased as the question where are we now? anyone who has travelled without gps knows this feeling. britain was a naval power and had a special interest in being able to reliably navigate the oceans. several european countries including britain offered prizes for a solution to the longitude problem at that time. two solutions were found, and one of them was to use an accurate clock and some observations of the stars to determine the longitude. the greenwich observatory was then used to keep accurate time by precisely measuring midday. starting in 1833 the observatory communicated the time by dropping a large time ball down a high pole every day so that nearby ships could synchronize their clocks (called chronometers) to it.</p>

            <p>towns in england kept their own time of day before the introduction of railways. when railways needed to keep tighter timetables in 1848, the railways standardized on the greenwich time, which then became the standard time across england and nearby territories.</p>

            <p>the greenwich observatory could observe precise local time, but real world irregularities of the motion of the earth would cause the solar time to disagree with the accurate mechanical clocks by up to 16 minutes faster or slower at different parts of the year. instead of reporting the irregular solar time, the astronomers used the solar time to keep their clocks accurate and reported the average time, they call it the mean time. that is how we got gmt, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">greenwich mean time</a>.</p>

            <p>in 1851 ships started determining their longitude in reference to the greenwich observatory, and in 1884 there was international standardization of the greenwich observatory as the reference longitude, also called the prime meridian, the definition of 0 degrees longitude. the same conference established that the universal day would have the new day time be midnight at greenwich mean time. in 1924 greenwich started transmitting the time via radio by the british broadcasting corporation. astronomers used midday to calibrate their clocks and had been using midday as the new day time. that was also convenient for looking at the stars at night, because all the observations overnight would be in the same calendar day. in 1928 universal time was established using gmt as the time and using midnight as the new day time. in 1955 the atomic clock was invented and atomic clocks keep amazingly consistent time. by 1960 several institutions operated their own atomic clocks and broadcast timing signals, so these institutions worked together to synchronize and coordinate their timing signals into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">coordinated universal time</a>. we abbreviate coordinated universal time as utc because of the french.</p>

            <p>the atomic clocks keep regular time, and the motions of the earth are not constant. since 1972, when the time observed by the motion of the earth differs from the time kept by the atomic clocks by too much, meaning the difference is going to exceed 0.9 seconds, a committee has a meeting and decides to add a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap second</a> to utc. there have been 27 leap seconds so far, and the schedule to add them is irregular, which makes dealing with them difficult.</p>

            <h3>24 hour time, military time</h3>
            <p>communicating datetimes is a matter of life and death in the military and several other professions such as aviation, and the common way of talking about time is error-prone. the military developed what we call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Military_time">military time</a> in the united states, it uses 24 hour time instead of 12 hour time with am and pm. military time also requires all leading zeros and skips the colon separator. to be explicit, military time is not in decimal, it is still in sexagesimal, it just skips the colon separator. military time assigned letters to the timezones, the most common one is utc which was assigned the letter z. when communicating letters over a military radio there are special words for each letter, like alpha for a and bravo for b. the word for z is zulu, so utc is called zulu time in military time. examples of military time</p>

            <h3>iso 8601</h3>
            <p>many regions have <a href="https://xkcd.com/1179/">different conventions</a> for how they write dates and times, so it is difficult to communicate dates and times across regions. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">iso 8601</a> is an international standard developed to help communicate gregorian dates and times. the first version of iso 8601 was published in 1988. people usually prefer to read dates using their regional format, so iso 8601 formatted dates are usually used by the software, and then the date is reformatted to display to the customer. iso 8601 takes the reasonable approach that datetimes should be written in the order of units from biggest to smallest, just like we write numbers. the order is year, month, day, hour, minute, second. the timezone goes last, even though it can shift the datetime by up to a day? date parts are separated by dashes, and time parts are separated by colons. the hours use 24 hour time. the timezone is the hour and minute offset from utc. the standard allows you to describe less precise datetimes by skipping all the parts you dont have, so 2022 is a valid iso 8610 datetime, where the month, day, hour, minute and second are all assumed to be their minimum value such as zero. example of a full iso 8601 formatted datetime</p>

            <h3>how did people track time before calendars or clocks</h3>
            <p>you can do very well tracking time with a couple sticks of wood or a runic staff.</p>

            <p>use one stick to keep a tally. a tally is a very simple way of writing numbers by making vertical marks like |||| meaning the number 4. start counting days in your tally from when you see a new moon. after 29 or 30 days the moon should be new again, you can look up at the sky to check, and reset your tally. that is one lunar cycle. keep a second tally to count the lunar cycles. after 12 lunar cycles a lunar year has passed and you can reset the lunar cycle count. every three lunar years add an extra lunar month to your lunar year and you are effectively implementing a lunisolar calendar with a stick.</p>

            <p>put the other stick in the ground pointing up and use it as a sundial. you can make marks on the ground where sunrise, sunset, and noon shadows were the previous day and can use it to track daytime.</p>

            <h3>egyptian calendar</h3>
            <p>the egyptians developed a 365 day solar calendar around 2450 bc. the egyptian calendar is exactly 365 days, using 12 months with 30 days each for 360 days and then the extra 5 days (intercalation). each month in the egpytian calendar has three weeks of ten days per week. the egyptian calendar uses a year, month, day format for dates. it lacked a leap year, so it slowly cycled through the seasons by shifting ~0.2422 days per year. the egpytians tried to add leap years to their calendar with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decree_of_Canopus">decree of canopus</a> in 238 bc but the reform was rejected. augustus ceasar was able to add a leap day in 25 bc, creating the alexandrian calendar / coptic calendar.</p>

            <h3>julian calendar</h3>
            <p>in 46 bc the roman emperor julius caesar returned to rome from visiting egpyt where among other things he learned about the egpytian calendar. julius instituted roman calendar reforms in 45 bc creating what is now called the julian calendar. the julian calendar combined the roman calendar with the egpytian calendar with additional improvements. the julian calendar is a solar calendar and has leap years. the julian calendar leap year is every four years, implying a year length of 365.25, which is off from ~365.2422.</p>

            <p>the roman senate later renamed the month quintilis in honor of julius, and it became the month of julius -> july. they renamed sextilis after a later roman emperor augustus -> august. the roman senate renamed other months after other people but those names didnt stick.</p>
