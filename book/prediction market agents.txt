prediction markets are resilient https://x.com/NathanpmYoung/status/1832694333599785319

prediction markets are a proven method to make predictions and decisions that can reliably perform as well or better than any other known decision method such as experts, seniority, voting, dictatorship, debate, surveys, etc.

a prediction market is like a stock in the stock market. anyone can buy and sell shares in it. the market's value changes based only on the activity of buyers and sellers. prediction markets are unlike stock markets in that a stock market has one stock for one company, while prediction markets have as many markets are you want, one market for each important question. the current value of a prediction market represents its prediction about a specific, answerable question. shares in prediction markets do not represent ownership of a company, they are bets on the answer to the question. for an open prediction market, the question must currently not have an answer, but we must be able to answer the question soon. before we get the answer to the question, we close the market from trading. once we have the answer to the question, we resolve the market and pay the shareholders who made correct predictions. we can use prediction markets to predict many things per company, and make decisions based on the predictions. the predictions will be as good or better than using any other method, so the decisions based on them will be among the best practically achievable decisions given the information available at the time.

for example, imagine we operate a retail store and we want to know, will it rain tomorrow around our store? if it will rain tomorrow, our store should display more umbrellas. if it will not rain, we should display more sunglasses. we open a prediction market. in our rain tomorrow prediction market, anyone can buy yes and no shares. why would traders want to buy shares in our market? because we pay an ante when we open the market that becomes part of the payout when the market resolves. the ante gives traders an incentive to participate, we are paying for information. the traders can trade until its time to act. at that time, we close the market and prepare the store for the next day based on the market's prediction. the next day, it either rains or it doesnt and we learn the answer to the question, did it rain today around our store? we resolve the market and pay the winners. this is different from a stock, because the prediction market closes and resolves instead of staying open as long as the company continues ot operate.

prediction markets let you make better decisions than other decision methods because they allow anyone to participate and the markets pay participants for making accurate predictions. the incentive of a prediction market is to be accurate, unlike other methods. a prediction market allows people to put their money where their mouth is and incentivize people who know better. if they are right then they will be paid for contributing to an accurate prediction that can then be applied to make a useful decision.experience with prediction markets shows that participants that buy or sell in the market for any reason other than accuracy will tend to lose money to people who are only seeking accuracy.

chapter: why dont companies use prediction markets?

applying prediction markets to company decisions would allow companies to make a lot lot lot more money. if companies want to make more money, why dont they use prediction markets? because companies have a fixed organizational and social structure that centralizes managers. the concept of a company is a hierarchy of managers over workers (org chart). managers make the decisions for the company. prediction markets are a tool that contradicts managers. managers have the authority to use or not use prediction markets. conventional companies will never use prediction markets. in order to apply prediction markets to business, we have to create a different organizational structure, companies without the conventional role of managers.

chapter: what are prediction market agents

prediction market agents is an organizational technology, a business in a box. it's a tool to help us work together, better. prediction market agents are companies that use prediction markets to make decisions. my goal with prediction market agents is to create an organizational process with better aligned incentives, creating organizations that more effectively pursue opportunities and accomplish their mission. the prediction market agent project will make it easy to form and operate these structurally and socially different organizations. these organizations will avoid some of the typical inefficiencies of conventional companies from their inception. this is the only practical way to apply prediction markets to business, improve our economy, governance, society, way of life and allow a vibrant, hopeful future for humanity.

chapter: conventional companies
there are already various kinds of companies today, such as small businesses, startups, multinational corporations and non-profits. i will call these conventional companies.

conventional companies today are better than earlier forms of organizations, yet there remain massive inefficiencies in conventional companies. in particular, companies often make avoidable bad decisions. they hire or fire the wrong people, invest in useless projects, squander their positive public reputation, ignore market threats and opportunities, and more. what is incredible is that most of the time, there are people that know the company's mistakes and opportunities in advance, but have no way to act on their accurate predictions. why dont managers listen to their knowledgable colleagues and customers? why dont conventional companies fix their inefficiencies and earn more profit? there are poorly aligned incentives in conventional companies that prevent them from eliminating these inefficiencies, even under competitive pressure from the market. managers can gain individual benefits at the company's expense until the company dies, then move to another company and do the same thing. conventional companies have poorly aligned incentives, so they often squander opportunities, fail their mission, and end up acquired or bankrupt. this is the organizational life cycle.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_life_cycle

chapter: immature technology

prediction market agents is a different way of doing business. whenever you look at a new paradigm from the point of view of the conventional paradigm, the new paradigm is plainly worse. between horses and cars, you can feed a horse some grass for free, but for cars you have to pay for gasoline. in this view, horses are better than cars. cars did replace horses for practical transport, because the car paradigm is overall better than the horse paradigm, even though you have to pay for gas.

the prediction market agent system looks very complicated, because it explicitly models the activities of an entire economy. compared to the economy that you implicitly face every day, this system is very simple. you dont use a single system to model our conventional economy, so this system looks complicated compared to nothing.

this is alpha software. it doesnt look right, it doesnt work right, you will be unfamiliar with it. overall it sucks. every new technology starts off worse than the mature alternatives. the question is not, does this system suck right now? it does. we know that this version of the system is worse than the alternative. the question should be, would prediction market agents, if it is more developed and properly applied, would it be a better organizational system than conventional companies, or not?

like the rest of my projects, none of these ideas are new and other people have tried similar things before. this project can succeed where others failed due to execution and timing, aka luck.

for example, the crypto people are developing something called daos, decentralized autonomous organizations.

chapter: prediction market agents system
the prediction market agent system implements my proposed process for running an organization with prediction markets. here are some diagrams!

image: image/prediction%20market%20agents/basic.svg

image: image/prediction%20market%20agents/process.svg

image: image/prediction%20market%20agents/credit.svg

anyone can create agents. an agent can be either an individual or an organization. every agent is a company the same way that you are a person and can create a sole proprietorship. agents purchase items and services for consumption and offer items and services for sale. agents that create value earn points, a hypothetical currency. points can be earned in three ways.

make accurate predictions in prediction markets
fixed payment for work
credit for work, profit sharing

agents complete tasks, tasks complete projects, projects develop products, products create items, and sales of items transfer points that are distributed according to the credit. agents can specialize or operate in several different roles, including prediction (trade in prediction markets), planning (define tasks), work (complete tasks) and evaluation (review the work).

section: how do prediction market agents use prediction markets?
there are five standard prediction market topics. every project needs to predict
0 how valuable is it?
1 how much will it cost?
2 how long will it take?

for tasks
3 how valuable is it to the project?
4 how long will it take?

project benefit, cost, timeline. accurate predictions make easy decisions. the agent can pursue projects with the rank order highest predicted long term return on investment ratio. these predictions can change in real time, making the prioritization of projects responsive to changing conditions. some projects have time limitations, such as preparing to sell sweaters before the winter, so the timeline prediction is necessary to decide timing.

all five of these topics provide critical predictions that support algorithmic decisions using all of the available information. crucially, all five of these questions have objective answers that can be resolved in a reasonable amount of time. if we propose or start working on a project today, we dont know how much money it will potentially earn, how much it will cost to complete, or how long it will take. on the day that we complete the project, we will know how long it took and how much it cost to that point. some time after we deliver a project, we will see the revenue.

how do we measure how valuable a task is to a project? you can do a project replication without that task, or create a fork of the product without the result of that task, and measure how much that task omission changes the value of the product.

apart from the standard five topics, agents can create prediction markets on any topic to make policy decisions. should an agent be granted or revoked a privilege, should we increase or decrease prices on a product, etc. these prediction markets need individual designs to resolve them accurately. a/b tests, replicating work, independent evaluators or experiments are needed to resolve the markets.

subsection: for hiring
over the course of a year, how much credit will this person earn in this role?
what will be the average work quality index for this persons work? work quality index is latency * work quality

chapter: why not build a prediction market platform? why does prediction market agents do all that other stuff?

the essential difference between conventional companies and prediction market agents is prediction markets. why not develop a prediction market platform that anyone and any company can use to create their own prediction markets as needed? why does prediction market agents need to do anything else, like project management or sales, when there are already many tools available to perform these functions? what do those functions have to do with prediction markets?

the technology of prediction markets is well known, proven effective and available to businesses, but remains unused. there are several prediction market platforms, and it is not too difficult to build your own prediction market platform if you choose.

knowing all this, the question is, why dont conventional businesses adopt and use prediction markets? dont they want to make money?

robin hanson claims that we dont need generic prediction market platforms that could be applied to any business, what we need for conventional businesses to adopt prediction markets is specialized prediction market tools that provide prediction market applications, ready to use and supported turnkey solutions for existing businesses. when engineers developed the technology of the steam engine, it was an interesting idea but it may have been hard for others to apply that idea to their business. no one knew how to manufacture, operate or maintain steam engines. only when new steam engine companies developed specialized steam engine based products or services for pumping water out of mines, then the steam engine industry begin to develop. robin advocates for creating similarly specialized prediction market applications to allow companies to buy a prediction market product with a specific application and a defined benefit, such as hiring prediction markets.

companies could buy a hiring prediction market tool where interviewers could predict, at the time of an interview, what the future employee review scores for candidates would be after one year of employment. the candidates with the highest predicted employee review scores would be hired. one year later they would complete their annual review and the prediction market could resolve. interviewers with higher employee prediction accuracy would earn money, giving interviewers an incentive to calibrate and help the company hire better employees. win win win!

hiring today is very expensive and error prone for businesses, and conventional businesses already spend a lot of money on products and services for hiring. are there no companies that can figure out how to use existing prediction market platforms to make their own hiring prediction markets and get better employees today? i think there are smart, talented, ambitious people at many companies that are already informed and capable of prediction market hiring.

i disagree with robin hanson that the missing link for conventional companies to adopt prediction markets is turnkey solutions. i think the reason that conventional companies have not adopted prediction markets is not any difficulty or confusion about prediction markets themselves. i think the managers of conventional companies understand the potential applications and benefits of prediction markets well enough. the reason conventional companies persistently and universally refuse prediction markets is that the managers do not want to adopt prediction markets. prediction markets can help the company, but prediction markets harm the interests of managers. the interests of the company and the manager as an individual do not align. this is the principal agent problem. if a manager wants to hire their friend but the hiring prediction market predicts that their friend is not the best choice, they cant hire their friend. if a manager wants to increase the headcount of their team but the prediction market predicts that a larger team would not create a corresponding increase in revenue, then they cant increase the size of their team. if a manager wants to start a project that makes them look good but the prediction market predicts that this project would have a negative return on investment, then they cant do their project. part of a manager's job is to make decisions. prediction markets make predictions, which potentially, or even usually, disagree with the manager's decision. managers are unilaterally able to decide whether to adopt prediction markets. which manager would choose to adopt a tool that will disagree with their decisions? no manager. none. prediction markets are persistently, universally rejected by managers of conventional companies.

conclusion. it is difficult to convince a manager to adopt prediction markets when their salary depends on not adopting prediction markets.

the only way for companies to adopt prediction markets is to form different kinds of companies without conventional managers. how can you operate a company without managers? you need new roles in the organization and tools fulfill all the roles that managers perform. the prediction market agents system has so many features beyond prediction markets because these features allow agents to coordinate to operate a business where the conventional role of managers is replaced by specialized roles like planners and evaluators, while decisions are made using prediction markets.

the prediction market agent system also handles things like tasks and sales to integrate the business operations with the prediction markets, assisting with creating, participating in and resolving prediction markets.

chapter: the principal agent problem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principal-agent_problem

the principal agent problem is a special term to describe a universal human problem. no person is an island, people depend on other people to meet their needs. other people do the work that i dont have the resources or ability to do myself. i need to drive places but i dont have the equipment or the know-how to maintain or repair my car. society solves this with specialization, and some people specialize in car repair. on the surface this is a perfect situation, i can specialize my work to what i do best and society needs most, everyone else can do the same, and we can all help each other. but a car mechanic has power over their customers. the mechanic has special knowledge that the customer does not have, and the mechanic can use their knowledge to defraud the customer for the mechanic's benefit. the mechanic can claim that a car needs an expensive service that the car does not require. the customer may not know whether the mechanic's claims are true or not, and taking the car to another mechanic for a second opinion also costs time and money. the cause of this problem is that mechanics are commonly paid per service and can earn more money by performing more services, even when those services are fraudulent. if you paid your mechanic a retainer instead, a continuous fee for keeping the car working, then the mechanic would have an incentive aligned with the customer to keep the car working while minimizing services. this incentive problem is a fundamental difference between pay for work and pay for result. pay for work increases the principal agent problem, and pay for result reduces the principal agent problem.

managers in conventional companies are the first example listed in the wikipedia article about the principal agent problem for good reason. managers limit communication between every party in a conventional company and create maximum information asymmetry. the role of managers creates a terrible principal agent problem. managers can deceive everyone, their own team members, other teams and upper management. manager performance is difficult to measure objectively, allowing corruption of feedback and collusion. manager roles have power and authority over other people, attracting power hungry sociopaths, politicians, cheats and liars. managers are paid in proportion to the number of employees in their team, giving managers a perverse incentive to increase headcount and power grab. we need to do a reorg! parasitic managers can make an endless stream of false claims, increase narrow metrics in the short term while sacrificing the future potential of the comapny to achieve its mission, claim victory, then run to another position or another company and sound the horn of their own triumphs, while the previous company loses potential growth, which is difficult to measure.

managers are political, so they are anti meritocratic and pro bureaucratic. bureaucracy is self serving, the bureaucracy is growing to meet the growing needs of the bureaucracy.

capable people should be successful in theory, but capable people are often unsuccessful in practice. this is partially because of the saying, its not what you know, its who you know. this expression describes that political connections are more important than results. if we reduce the principal agent problem in companies, then the saying will revert to the common sense nonpolitical version, its not who you know, its what you know.

choosing reliable, honest, capable, mission driven managers is a successful strategy. but now the incentive for a nefarious agent is to find a way to deceive you to appear reliable, honest, capable and mission driven when they are not, like politicians. until now, we have not found a way to eliminate the principal agent problem of managers in conventional companies.

chapter: replacing conventional managers
a conventional manager concentrates many roles into one person. in my experience, a manager is responsible for the following garbage bin of responsibilities that individually might not be difficult, but it is rare to find one person that does all or most of these well simultaneously.

underline: responsibilities of conventional managers
hiring workers, including job listings, interviews, negotiations, onboarding
administration
scheduling of projects, meetings, work hours, vacations
budgeting and resource allocation
define work process
define tasks
assign tasks, reassign tasks, cancel tasks
coordinate tasks with other teams
check progress
report progress
evaluate work
allocate credit
evaluate workers
compensation negotiation
assign or conduct worker training
worker coaching
make or oversee team decisions
monitor, adjudicate and enforce company policy
performance improvement and firing workers
receive and implement directives from upper management
communicate between the organization and their team
receive, coordinate and resolve problems about their team
receive, coordinate and resolve problems from workers
advocate on behalf of the company to the workers
advocate on behalf of the workers to the company
shift blame from themselves to others

managers are often highly paid, self important, micro managing or checked out. the relationship between the worker and their manager is the largest factor in worker satisfaction, meaning it is likely that if you love your job then you love your boss, or if you hate your job then you hate your boss. a process such as scrum can shift some of the responsibilities from the software team manager to the team, such as task definition, task assignment and scheduling. but most companies and teams that say they do scrum dont really do it and degenerate back towards manager command and control.

managers do not want to use prediction markets, so if we want to use prediction markets then we need to replace managers with new roles that have aligned incentives. all of this work that managers are supposed to do needs to be reallocated to new roles in the organization. instead of managers planning tasks, specialized planners plan tasks, or workers plan their own work, like scrum proposes to do. instead of managers evaluating tasks, specialized evaluators evaluate work, or workers evaluate each others tasks, like we do with code review in software development. instead of your manager deciding credit, everyone involved evaluates credit and the algorithm resolves it. instead of the manager making decisions, everyone can trade in prediction markets that make decisions.

communicate between the organization and their team
typical communication channels, chatrooms, email, wiki, social media, gossip. rumors quashed or validated by prediction markets, put up or shut up
receive, coordinate and resolve problems about their team
conventional error handling systems such as customer support, prioritization by prediction market, tasks completed by workers
receive, coordinate and resolve problems from workers
insider problems handled the same way as outsider problems
advocate on behalf of the company to the workers
no need to advocate, elimination of politics, use prices and prediction markets to decide
advocate on behalf of the workers to the company
flxible workforce allows workers to advocate with their feet. prediction markets can change policy for mutual benefit.
shift blame from managers to others
its impossible to blame something that doesnt exist :)

section: this process looks heavy and complex

it is a lot of boring repetitive extra work to track all this activity. you can use less granular, bigger tasks to do less reporting. also repetitive actions can eventually be automated so the extra work will eventually go to zero. also this tracking is not wasteful. it provides these specific valuable benefits that are worth far more than the process effort. if the process effort isnt worth the benefits then you may be blind to the benefits or this process is not appropriate for your application.

all of this is making explicit work that is already done implicitly, or work that people agree should be done, but often isnt. for example, task definition is sometimes done, but is often skipped. managers prefer workers that know what to do without asking. a shared, implicit understanding of priorities and procedure saves a lot of work and improves efficiency. but when problems or changes inevitably occur, there is no paper trail or established communication to rely on, leading to larger losses. it is also easier for the manager to blame the worker when there is no communication and the work is implicit. the work to define tasks is often skipped when everyone should agree that task definition is beneficial. if we eliminate the option of implicit work, we also reduce the tendency for hierarchy. task definition, task completion and task evaluation are all just work. someone else might define tasks for you to define, then you define them, and a third person evaluates your tasks.

chapter: why conventional companies dont use prediction markets
why do conventional companies avoid prediction markets?
is it because conventional companies have not heard about prediction markets? no. the information about prediction markets has been available for decades.
are prediction markets expensive or difficult to try? no. the cost to try prediction markets is affordable for many organizations, and they have been trialed several times.
do prediction markets only work in theory, and they dont work in practice? companies have tried prediction markets in practice. when companies tried prediction markets with an appropriate methodology, they found that prediction markets work in practice.
for example, google operated an internal employee-only prediction market service for several months, and then closed it down. the markets worked as described.

why do conventional companies avoid prediction markets? because prediction markets make decisions! there are already people employed at conventional companies as decision makers, the executives. the executives want to keep doing what they are already doing, they do not want to be replaced or overruled by prediction markets. executives also have the authority to decide whether to use prediction markets or not. executives unanimously choose to not use prediction markets. it is very hard to convince someone to use a tool when their salary depends on their not using it. that is why conventional companies avoid prediction markets.

there is no practical, technical or legal reason to avoid prediction markets. as a decision-making tool, prediction markets can be state of the art. existing businesses are showing us that there are strong incentives for executives to avoid using prediction markets.

chapter: how can we change the incentives to favor using more effective methods?
organizations typically calcify around a particular way of doing business and resist many kinds of change. i propose that the only way to change the incentives to use these or other unconventional methods is to form new competitive organizations that operate using these methods from the beginning. the improved methods will give a new company an advantage over an incumbent. then the incentives would favor using more effective methods. either the incumbent will respond to even the advantage, such as by adopting prediction markets, or the new company will take market share away from the incumbent and profit.

draw out the open company diagram for closed loop processes. maybe separately describe differences in labor market dynamics between an open and conventional company.

chapter: the ideal and the reality of conventional companies

there are good people who act responsibly everywhere. good people that follow the rules, find effective ways to solve problems, act in the best interests of themselves, the company, the community and the environment. it is equally true that there are bad people everywhere too, they are irresponsible, violate the rules, act selfish or ideologically and harm the company, the community, the environment, and often themselves. there is a third kind of person, the mediocre majority of people. they are incapable, ineffective, muddled, short sighted, disinterested. they cant make new ideas, cant complete difficult projects or tasks, allow bad people to do what they want, and prevent good people from acting. the typical conventional company collects mediocre people, protects bad people, crushes good people, forgets its mission and fails out of the market (the conclusion of the business cycle). the goal of a prediction market agent is to filter out the mediocre people, crush the bad people, protect the good people and fulfill its mission using market forces.

conventional companies are a mixture of functional and dysfunctional dynamics. in some companies at some times, things work how they are supposed to work and things go well. at other times, things dont work how they are supposed to work for many reasons.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert
the comic strip dilbert is a parody of office work, like the movie office space and the tv show, the office. these media are famous partly due to funny jokes, but they are mainly famous because no matter how ridiculous the situation they portray, real life events found a way to make them look like an unbiased and unremarkable documentary.

grid2:
how companies are supposed to work
how companies typically work
profitable company needs to hire more staff to meet growing market demand or to enter a new part of the market
unprofitable company hires more staff to increase the number of employees under a manager to make them look more important, use an allocated budget, add staff to try to speed up a project behind schedule
hiring manager writes accurate job description. includes required skills and qualities, work environment, department, team, typical work for the position and pay range. the post is up for a week or two and removed immediately after enough applicantions have been received.
someone copies and maybe modifies an existing and inaccurate job description. word salad. listed required skills are irrelevant, actual required skills are not listed. required experience is overstated. no mention of what the work will be, or the team listed is inaccurate. no pay range included, it is inaccurate or open to negotiation. job listings stay open, unfilled for months or years.
qualified applicants apply with accurate information customized to the job requirements.
applications flood in but most of the applications are so inaccurate that they could be called fraudulent. recruiters looking for a large commision submit inaccurate applications on behalf of job seekers.
after a few days of collecting applications, the hiring manager selects several of the most promising applicants and interviews them briefly to confirm their qualifications and see if they can work together. they shortly make a decision and negotiate the details with the selected applicants for a straightforward hire. employee starts in a probationary period and leaves quickly if it doesnt work out.
extended interview process that takes weeks or months to schedule and conclude. phone screen, work sample, skills interview, behavioral interviews, meet the team, meet the manager, salary negotiation, offer letter, background check, first day. applicants are rejected at any time, sometimes silently, and without feedback.
company offers the job with payment at the market rate for the applicant's skills in their industry
company offers lowest payment they think the applicant will accept. employees are paid different amounts for the same job even with similar qualifications and similar performance. if an applicant can arrange multiple job offers simultaneously, they can entice the companies to bid against each other and increase their offers.
applicant takes an appropriate amount of time to consider the offer of employement
offer letter expires in 24 hours to prevent applicants from shopping offers and renegotiating
applicant soon becomes a new employee and starts learning their new job on their first day. their new team helps train the new employee in addition to adequate information, facilities and opportunity. they are quickly able to participate. if for any reason they arent able to contribute, they quit or are fired.
company isnt ready for the employee to start for weeks, their new employee introduction takes over a week before they can start learning their job. the employee mostly has to figure out their job for themselves with inadequate information, facilities, opportunity or support. if they arent able to contribute, it takes months or longer to fire them.
the team works together to complete the most work with the highest quality
employees do as little as possible, defend their position, or try to get the most prestigious work to raise their position
the team manager helps to plan and deliver the most work with the highest quality while promoting the development of the team members. takes responsibility for problems and helps resolve them within the team and across teams. delegates as much as possible to the people doing the work.
the team manager micromanages, plays favorites, or checks out. they gate keep, all communication must channel through the manager who shifts blame and makes their team look shiny to everyone else. all time spent in meetings and reporting to upper management.
the company network has relevant and accurate information, timely communication
the wiki has no documentation about major projects, and outdated information when present. email comes frequently but is not informative or urgent, but sometimes someone expects you to reply immediately so you have to check frequently. slack has hundreds of channels with chatter, confusion and drama. employees receive frequent notifications with low signal to noise, but high cost of not checking.
meetings are scheduled to solve problems with specific groups of employees. organizers prepare materials in advance and participants arrive on time and prepared to discuss the problem. during the meeting, participants join or leave the meeting depending on whether they are needed. the group works to understand the problem and come to a decision with the right level of risk as quickly as possible, produces a record of the problem, their conclusions and the decision. by the end of the meeting every participant knows what they need to do to take the next step to resolve the problem.
regular meetings happen with large groups to report status to a manager or for a manager to announce information to the employees. these are always a waste, because reporting can happen asynchronously. people come to meetings unprepared and do not take the time in the meeting to prepare. necessary people are not present in the meeting, and unnecessary people remain in the meeting. people make decisions and no one knows why afterward. if the decision is wrong, you are unsure if the original decision maker knew something that you dont. if the decision is right, you might reverse it for a mistaken reason that they previously avoided.
employees receive raises and promotions as their productivity increases and their pay adjusts to the market. employees can occasionally change teams to help where needed, work with specific colleagues or learn new skills.
pushy employees get raises and quiet employees dont. employers dont promote their employees, so employees change companies to advance. managers keep employees in the same role for years or shift them to other teams as convenient to them. managers fire the most experienced employees to save money.
the product team researches customers and the market, monitors products, explores opportunities and prioritizes the most valuable work for the companys success
product team chases individual contracts, copies competitors, ignores customer benefit and doesnt create value
management keeps track of the state of the company and the market to lead the company to continuous success
management shifts blame, takes credit, grows budget and headcount for personal success at the expense of the company
employees of different departments work together to make the company successful. all employees try to make improvements and managers consider all proposals. good ideas can come from anywhere.
keep your head down, the manager knows best, do what i told you, command and control, competition between departments, the right hand doesnt know what the left hand is doing
only do work within the company core competence. buy competitive products and services outside the core competence.
not built here syndrome
share information about everything you do that is not the core competency or market advantage of the company to allow suggestions or share best practices. everyone benefits.
everything proprietary, nobody benefits and no criticism.
complete projects that create value and maintain them to continue to create value and create more value with improvements. allow anyone with the skills and interest to improve the system.
develop, abandon, exclude. solve the immediate problem with a system, prevent anyone from touching the working system. focus on the next problem and abandon the system until it breaks and becomes the problem again.

humans are not resources. humans have resources because humans create resources. humans can trade their resources to better satisfy their preferences, creating gains from trade, an economy. the people that offer to trade their resources with a company are not company resources, they are current trading partners. worker dissatisfaction is a symptom of unhealthy markets due to illiquidity, market manipulation and similar. human resource departments are essential to conventional companies because their function is how the company gets employees, which is the resource the company can apply to get anything done. healthy and innovative conventional companies have functional hr departments, almost all conventional companies have dysfunctional hr departments. prediction market agents support a highly transparent and liquid market in services, a realtime labor market. the conventional role of human resources is eliminated, and the responsibilities are handled partly by the system, and others will likely be handled by new roles that have better aligned incentives, such as career agents. creating custom systems of permissions can be something that planners do, evaluating agents to grant or revoke permissions can be done by either prediction markets or evaluators. testing different policies for permissions can be handled by experimenters.

chapter: incentives

one typical incentive for work is pay. other incentives include camaraderie, the development and expression of mastery and the joy of being useful to others. for some people having an occupation is a way to escape other parts of their life. if someone isnt distracted by work, they will pursue other distractions including time wastes and addictions.

it comes down to accountability. a business owner is accountable to the market, if their business produces value, they can succeed in the market and be paid for the value they produce. if their business doesnt produce value, the market holds them accountable and stops paying them. someone paid a salary is not immediately accountable for producing value, they can become a free rider. managers are hard to hold accountable because the value they can create is hard to estimate. beyond that, managers are a distinct and self promoting social group that themselves hold the power to hold others accountable and not hold themselves accountable. the incentives is for managers to protect their own, not to hold each other accountable. individual contributors produce estimable value, entrepreneurs and owners are exposed to the market, middle management is insulated from accountability, and prevents individual contributors from taking accountability. what did you accomplish this week?

chapter: payment

subsection: commission
commission is pay for result. if i make 10 widgets, you pay me one coin per widget so you pay me 10 coins. the worker is exposed to all the complexity and risk. efficiency is the workers problem, the buyer can pay a flat amount per widget. this is one of the most effective methods of payment. one downside is that externalities are hard to internalize without monitoring. this method is hard to apply to most jobs. widgets might be a commodity, but what about the people who maintain the widget machines or the people who answer phone calls? evaluating their results is harder to define. you could pay for operational machine hours or phone calls completed, but how to incentivise preventative maintenance, or customer satisfaction? pay for result should be the standard payment method, i think we should face the difficulty of evaluating the value of work.

subsection: hourly wage
an hourly wage pays for time. if a worker shows up to the factory and is available to make widgets but the widget machine needs unscheduled maintenance that day, the worker wouldnt make any money from commissions even though they were ready to work. the problem is the employer didnt have reserved widget machines or hired too many widget workers. one solution is to pay the worker for their work hours, and then even if they make different numbers of widgets in a day they will be paid the same. now the number of widgets produced per worker is the employer's concern, not the workers, so the workers can have stable income and do their best while the employer has the incentive to increase the widgets per worker. this method has several silly consequences, rigid work schedules that dont accomodate changing circumstances, drag ass and make work to spend more hours, favoritism and bullying by cutting scheduled hours, myopic pursuit of metrics while ignoring quality or other hard to quantify dimensions that also contribute to value. focusing on whether a worker is sitting in a chair for a certain number of hours rather than what the worker produces is horrible.

for specialist labor such as lawyers or mechanics, charging an hourly rate allows them to offer their specialized services to the market with the ability to give price estimates before starting work. they can offer their services to the wide market for anyone who needs them and can afford their rate. their customers are typically non specialists, so the incentive is to commit fraud and claim more hours than they spent. in the other direction, if the client has a maximum price they can afford and the project goes over budget, which can easily happen even to capable and experienced experts, the project can fail, the client can be dissatisfied at paying much more than quoted, or the specialist can be underpaid for their labor.

subsection: salary
salary work is pay for time in a loose way. it is hard to estimate worker value or productivity, so a salary worker is expected to work at least a certain number of hours per week at certain times of day, but they are paid a fixed salary no matter the exact number of hours that they work. they do not need to account for every minute of their time. managers form a general opinion of the workers productivity but this kind of work is difficult to quantify. often the manager can only really compare employees against each other, i get more value from this employee over that one, or this employee has a skill that none of the other employees can replace. the employer has the advantage over the employees by secretly negotiating individual salaries with each employee and offering them the minimum salary that they think the employee will accept. due to increased employee turnover, employees can now get higher salaries by changing to jobs with better pay. on the other hand, the interview process is so expensive and job offers are so inconsistent that i think employers maintain a significant advantage with salaries. i am against pay for time.

subsection: tenure
essentially unconditional pay. a tenure position is paid a fixed salary with very low work requirements and is hard to terminate. tenure is almost a job for life. most people would exploit a job with high pay and low requirements to take the money and do nothing. why would anyone offer a job with tenure? the goal of offering a job with tenure is to identify highly capable and self motivated people and support them to do what they wanted to do anyway, especially if you can not know what they need to do in advance. this method is only proven successful in special areas such as research or the judiciary. research is exploratory, expensive and difficult, but the benefits from discoveries can be worth the risks. it is sometimes profitable to pay people to do whatever they want, but only in special circumstances and with special people. tenure is not a good payment method for work in general.

subsection: stock based compensation
pay for indirect company profit. many employees receive some form of stock based compensation, and some executives receive only stock based compensation. in theory the stock price of a company is the market's best estimate of the companies future earnings. if an individual employee can significantly contribute to increase the companys future profits, then the stock price will increase and that employee will receive a percentage of the value they created. in a limited way this is an ideal form of payment for results. in practice, stock prices swing wildly in the short and even the medium term due to many factors including macroeconomic swings that do not reflect company or individual creation of value, called macro effects and irrationality. the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvant. in theory the stock market price should stay around the underlying long term value of the company, in practice the value theory is smashed by an insane obsession with quarterly numbers that have little to do with underlying long term value. in my own experience of stock based compensation, i was offered slowly vesting stock options that i needed to pay for myself in a complex and pointless procedure that was more of an expensive hassle than a form of payment. in theory i support stock based compensation but in practice it is usually counterproductive, wasteful and unreactive. even if someone creates value, they may receive stock compensation years later and depending on how they administer it or due to market conditions they may earn nothing or even lose money. liquidating stock based compensation for the maximum profit requires timing the market, which is impossible in general.

chapter: camaraderie
humans are social animals, we need interaction with other people to thrive. solitary confinement is considered the worst punishment for criminals because it deprives them of social interaction. one of the benefits of work in an organization is camaraderie, camaraderie includes these joys
- working with other people to achieve a shared objective
- being needed by someone else
- being able to fulfill other peoples needs
- fulfilling other peoples needs
- trusting other people
- being trusted
- combined efforts achieving something you could not do by yourself
- maybe a separate section about being useful

chapter: skills, experience, mastery
one of the benefits of work is developing your skills. as a child you develop skills for your potential future, because other people tell you to, or for fun. in industry you provide a service and you have the repeated opportunity to satisfy customers. the feedback of finding and satisfying customers is the most real and reliable feedback available, except for logical truth. practice with feedback is the most effective way to develop skills, and greater skill produces greater value in the market. there is a joy in growth and a joy in creating value.

chapter: work styles
section: just tell me what you want done and leave me alone
work is a basic transaction, something you do to get money. identity, belonging and meaning are either unfulfilled or fulfilled elsewhere. does not want to engage socially, strategically, politically. does not want to coordinate. does not like change. just let me show up as usual, do my work in peace and go home, please. degenerate teamwork is possible by dividing responsibility. you do your part and everything else is not your job. this works when everything is consistent and routine, but does not work when the business changes or has exceptions. they also do not want a tool that tells them that they are doing their job wrong, forces them to think for themselves, coordinate with others.

section: negative nancy
work is torture, everyone should be tortured equally. i will monitor everyone, complain and gossip. cannot join a team because they are entirely focused on reducing, avoiding or sharing negative reinforcement. positive reinforcement is a cruel joke. does not want a tool that offers them choice or opportunity.

section: lets do something together
work is a pastime you can spend with other people. its nice to spend time with other people, its nice to be needed. the money and whether the work is useful are less important. occupational therapy. distraction from thinking about yourself or your problems. teamwork is possible, but high achievement isnt the goal so it isnt found. will keep doing things that are ineffective indefinitely as long as they arent solitary. does not want a tool to make their cooperation competitive, but can appreciate invitations to be more needed and helpful.

section: i want to do good, enforce justice, protect the vulnerable, right wrongs
work is a mission to fix the world, a virtuous battle for what is right. idealistic charities, ngos, activists, lawyers, judges, police, charities, clergy, teachers. the overriding importance of feeling good about yourself, that you are doing the right thing, that you are a good person means that ethics, money, truth and the effects of your actions are less important. teamwork is possible with other true believers, but the requirements for conformity continually rise and ultimately everyone is an infidel. their modus is victory at all costs, so cost is unimportant to them, as is effectiveness, so they do not want a tool to improve efficiency, track cost, tell them that they are inefficient, hence effective altruism as an oxymoron.

section: i want to express myself, create beauty
work is whatever you can find to pay you for self expression, the only work you find fulfilling. you are a graphic artist, but they will only pay you for creating advertisements, so be it. payment is typically low, what is most important is gaining creative control, so you can more fully express yourself. teamwork is possible if you can share a creative vision, which is possible with shared values and aesthetic, but not common. does not like a tool that reduces their value to numbers, qualitative feedback is more important.

section: i want to compete
work is a way for me to win, get the thrill of the challenge. the winners survive and the losers die. competition is zero sum or even negative sum. if you team up to defeat an external competitor, they can do some teamwork. but there is always an internal competition too, and internal competition is much more visceral and immediate. internal competition is antithetical to teamwork. likes a tool to help them find challenges, compete, see their progress, win, get credit.

section: i will do what it takes for money or status
work is a way for me to get money or status. what i do, how it affects other people are less important than getting what i want. teamwork against an external group is possible, but teamwork for internal purposes is impossible, every person for themselves. wants a tool to make more money but does not want a tool that takes away status games.

section: i want to lead
work is a way to be needed and harness human potential. teamwork is possible if other people do not also want to lead. do not want a tool to take away their leadership role.

section: i want to understand
work is a way for me to solve problems, fight fires, the thrill of the chase. can do teamwork, but will chase after every problem without discretion between important problems and unimportant problems, treating symptoms instead of causes. fire fighters. likes a tool to give them credit for solving problems and collecting problems for them to solve, but dont want to face the thankless not valuable work they compel themselves to do.

section: i want to find opportunities
work is a way for me to profit from my discoveries. i want to be first, find something, gain benefits and tell other people that i was there first. can join a team but will compete with other seekers. does want a tool to give them credit for finding opportunities. early adopter, stock trader.

section: i want to explore
work is a way for me to explore the unknown, expand my horizons. what i do, where i go, what i achieve are less important than travelling somewhere new to me. can produce value, but cannot be directed and cant be part of a team with a specific objective. math. does not want a tool to tell them whether they are productive, do not care.

section: i want to be professional
work is a duty, and i do it properly. professionalism is part of my identity, but the particular work and the consequences of my work are less important as long as i have done my part. i have a limited responsibility to consider and contribute to the larger picture. i can join a team, and appreciate accurate feedback, as a professional.

section: high performance team
work is a way for me to achieve together much more than i could do alone. i have specialties, but i will pick up whatever needs to be done to complete the objective. teamwork oriented, values specialists, leaders, other team players.

chapter: belonging, group identity, filling a role, doing it for someone else
joining a company is joining a tribe. you have pride in your company history, achievements, cultural relevance. by working there, that tribe is part of your identity with a special name, a logo, colors, clothing and more. you feel part of a larger group and mission that supports your life and you are willing to sacrifice for in return. the tribe accepts you, and you feel comfortable that there is somewhere you belong.

chapter: negative incentives of concentional companies

section: hierarchy, dominance, self esteem, dark triad narcissism machiavellianism psychopathy
if you want to get paid to lie, cheat, steal, manipulate, dominate and make other people suffer, the job you want is to be a manager. companies will pay you to treat other people badly for your own benefit, in the name of the company. this is because treating people as resources allows you to maximize short term benefits, a simplistic and misguided company strategy. the reason that dark triad are invited into management is that the proper role of a manager is not oblivious, weak, credulous or easy. managers properly require strength of will and a certain kind of objectivity that puts results over peoples feelings. its an unhappy coincidence that unfeeling monsters can be very objective. they want to be managers and companies want managers that look a lot like them. but the excesses of dark triad can destroy lives and companies. i want to create organizations that resist and reject antisocial behavior.

narcissism is characterized by grandiosity, pride, egotism, and a lack of empathy.
machiavellianism is characterized by manipulation and exploitation of others, indifference to morality, lack of empathy, and a strategic focus on self-interest.
psychopathy is characterized by continuous antisocial behavior, impulsivity, selfishness, callous and unemotional traits, and remorselessness.

section: extraction
work for hire is assumed to be voluntary. the employer voluntarily wants work to be done and offers a job to the market. workers voluntarily join the job market to do work and voluntarily choose an employer and a job to do, in exchange for money. in a healthy market, there is diversity in the kinds of companies and jobs and workers that allow most participants to get what they want most of the time, all voluntary because trade is positive sum. people need money for shelter and food, so people need money to live. in practice, many markets are unhealthy, which leads to involuntary exchange, extraction. if getting a job is costly and risky, once someone has a job, demands from their employer can be similar to threats with a gun to their head. if the employee doesnt comply, the employer threatens to fire them, which could plausibly result in death. if you need money to live and getting a job is uncertain, you have to do whatever your current employer demands even if you dont want to, wage slavery. this allows employers to demand more and more from employees, reaching an equilibrium of maximum suffering for the employee and maximum profit for the employer in a narrow sense. this describes sweat shops in the garment industry, for example. the most successful companies do not treat their employees this way, because defection is not a winning strategy in a repeated game. with extraction, the company is defecting in a repeated game, so they lose out eventually if anyone else applies the winning strategy. but when management is psychopathic, or they can only respond to simplistic metrics, extraction is the strategy they use. this strategy is unstable because some workers do die, others find any alternative that is less extractive, and the remaining workers stop responding to threats and cant be motivated. the workforce is embittered, sometimes causing a worker revolt. this is also a basis for collective action, a labor union, a worker organization to create an agent with bargaining power equal to the employer. the incentives of the labor union are misaligned with the interests of the employer and also mistaligned with the interests of the workers, but it can reduce extraction and worker revolts.

will an agent in prediction market agents attempt to or become extractive? if prediction market agents is used widely enough, people will be extractive because it is a dominant strategy in one time games. societies can create circumstances that cause markets to become unhealthy and create wage slavery with prediction market agents. i cant control the world, change human nature or change the math of game theory. i cant prevent all unhealthy markets or human abuse. what prediction market agents can do is increase the efficiency of agents to create greater gains from trade, which makes the dominant strategy in repeated games win more, defeat extraction in more cases and sooner, reducing extraction overall but not preventing it completely. decreasing costs to market entry, increasing worker mobility, vouching, transparency and other systems all couteract the tendency for extraction.

section: zero sum competition in conventional companies
conventional companies create a variety of zero sum competitions which invite negative sum strategies.

if a company roadmap for the next fiscal year has room for 10 projects, then as a manager i need to make sure that i have a project on that roadmap. even better, i want to prevent other managers from getting their projects on the roadmap so i can beat them.

if the company has a fixed budget for the next year, then they want to allocate the budget among the different departments. i want to get the most money for my department, and all the other departments want to do the same, so i also want to prevent other departments from getting money so there is more money for my department. typically budgets are on a use it or lose it policy, which is incredibly stupid, encouraging wasteful spending at the end of the year if everything goes well, and panicked budget requests when unexpected problems arise.

its a social law that only one person can ultimately be in charge, and whoever is in charge can often use their authority for their own benefit. that means that people compete in every way that they can, including underhanded methods, to take power and become the one in charge. when a manager leaves their position, only one person can be hired to replace them. if you get the job, then i dont get the job, and if i get the job, you dont get the job.

section: short term vs long term
short term planning and long term planning are so different that they are almost unrelated. of course, completing the immediate task, delivering an order to a customer and other day to day concerns are necessary to operate a business and create the possibility of long term survival. the modern ability to collect and compute real time data allows us to see and react to moment to moment changes in a business. our immediate experience of a dissatisfied customer in our face or the daily movements of a charted metric is visceral and obvious. long term trends and fundamental underlying factors are often invisible and change slowly, over the course of at least weeks if not years. the future is always hazy and unpredictable, so all that businesspeople can typically do is respond like prey animals to unexpected sounds. they jump and run away. there are people who can observe and appropriately respond to long term trends and fundamental factors in business, but they are hard to find, and they are politically inconvenient to listen to. long term thinkers can lead a company to sustained success if they establish an authoritative position, but long term thinking itself does not usually help them achieve that position. someone like a company founder can succeed as a long term thinker, or they can place long term thinkers in positions with authority, but eventually conventional businesses tend to succumb to extreme short term thinking, reactivity, myopia. they chase their quarterly numbers or narrow metrics, fail to observe or respond to powerful long term trends and go out of business.

chapter: idiots, 10x engineers, software engineering
the eighty twenty rule appears in organizations, where approximately 80% of the work is completed by 20% of the workers. this means that a few people are good at their jobs, and almost everyone else contributes relatively little, they are almost irrelevant, and sometimes counter productive. finding great people is difficult, great people are rare, idiots are everywhere. this is a huge problem. there arent enough great people to do all the work that we need to do. what should society do with all the idiots, the people who arent very productive at any job? how do you collect the great people? how do you keep the idiots out of the important positions, but also find a way to allow the idiots to produce the maximum value that they are capable of? we must make it as easy as possible for anyone to try any job and demonstrate their objective competence. this includes career agents, people who are good at determining and matching people with their competence and specific jobs. we cant predict every loser that could suddenly produce a towering work of genius, but established and repeatable jobs should be possible. we should be meritocratic, we should align incentives so that people who produce the most value get the most rewards and encourage them to find the most valuable work they can do and do the most work that they can. sometimes this might mean an intense work focus for some period of time, and it might also mean a very pleasant work life balance at other times.

chapter: minimum wage
a minimum wage is stupid.

thats all that i should need to say, but i will be more explicit about why i think so. i am allowed to do something without anyone paying me. there is no minimum wage for how i use my own time. i can do a favor for someone else without them paying me either. i can work for someone and they can pay me for it, as long as they pay me more than the minimum wage. why cant i voluntarily work for someone and they can pay me a tiny amount? what if i wanted to do something anyway, and someone wanted to pay me a little bit for it? thats ok, because they are donating to my voluntary effort, i am not their employee. the fact is that there are many things that people dont really mind doing, that other people would pay a little money for, that are illegal due to the minimum wage law. a common case is someone without experience. someone without experience isnt capable or productive, yet. why should i pay them the same wage that i pay to someone who is fully capable and productive? the minimum wage just makes certain kinds of voluntary agreements between citizens illegal when there is no benefit. advocates of the minimum wage dont understand economics, which is fine, not everyone has to understand economics, but they are wrong about this. raising the minimum wage doesnt increase wages for poor people, raising the minimum wage inflates prices for some businesses, shifting sales to less affected substitutes. increasing the minimum wage reduces legal work for low skilled workers. the minimum wage keeps low skilled people unemployed, preventing them from gaining skills on the job and blocking a huge range of valuable work from getting done. wait staff, cooks, cleaners, gardeners, various forms of maintenance and repair, these are all ways to get people working and benefiting society that have a low hourly wage, but so what? is sitting while looking at your phone better for you instead of making money below the minimum wage? since when is some money less than no money? if the problem is that people are trapped in a small town or specific industry, help them by offering relocation or retraining. if companies are extractive, make it easier to start competitors that attract all the best talent.

chapter: worker preferences
from a conventional point of view, worker preferences are unimportant. the important thing is to offer an attractive product in the market and make money. the people who create the product are a byproduct, the workers are resources, cogs. how the workers feel about creating the product is a byproduct of a byproduct, totally irrelevant. anyone with a milligram of perspective knows that the methods and conditions of producing the product are in fact part of the product, part of the cost of producing the product, thus part of the profit. processes and working conditions are not a byproduct, they are part of the product and should be a central concern of a well run business. ok, workers and their preferences matter. what do they want?

declining labor force participation
us bureau of labor statistics https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-labor-force-participation-rate.htm

section: useful work
workers want their work to be useful, to advance a larger, meaningful mission. you can pay people to dig a hole and then fill the hole in again, then dig it again ad infinitum. you can record that as giving people work, we are increasing the gross domestic product. i find useless work depressing, maddening, demotivating. i want to do something that someone else wants! i want to help! dont pay me to waste my time!

section: interesting work
workers want to do something interesting, at least sometimes. indefinite, mindless, repetitive work is sad. if there is repetitive physical motion it eventually causes physical injuries and disability. keeping work interesting to people is difficult, because interest is relative to capability, and capabillities vary a lot between people and within a person at different times in their life and even different times of day. interesting is a level of task difficulty. task difficulty can range from trivial, easy, interesting, hard, impossible. for people, driving along a straight highway is more dangerous than a highway with changing curves and slopes. a straight highway is a trivial challenge and causes the driver to focus on other things or fall asleep, eventually causing accidents. a highway with curves goes from trivial to easy, keeping the driver engaged with the driving task. but many people dont enjoy driving for hours every weekday, driving isnt interesting until you increase the challenge level to interesting or hard with, for example, car racing. keeping work interesting usually means doing something new or different or trying to improve at a task. if a task is truly repetitive, it should be automated. a work task is by my definition not interesting if it is useless.

section: work variety
workers are people, and people are not machines, people thrive on variety. it is often efficient for people to specialize in narrow roles or tasks and just do that one thing over and over, everyone can really get used to doing that one thing and everyone knows exactly what to do and no one needs to explain anything or coordinate, everyone just works and works. this is an explore exploit problem. there is an optimal amount of exploitation where people just do something fixed for a period of time to produce the most value per unit time, but ultimately this will lead to injuries, stagnation, burnout, loss of interest. even though it is less efficient in the moment, workers need to change tasks, learn new skills, try other parts of the business from time to time. there is a japanese corporate custom where workers join every different department in the company one by one. eventually, when someone is promoted to be the next president of the company, they have experience working in every department, they know the people, processes, problems, the different cultures, they all know how to work together.

section: help society
when i go to work, i want my work to be for something beneficial to the customer. i would not want to produce addictive drugs, advertise unnesessary products, offer non-fiduciary financial products, produce banal entertainment. i have a list of antisocial industries that i do not want to participate in. i dont think there is a bright moral line between robbing someone at gunpoint and getting their money by preying on their mental weakness. i am not advocating that those industries should be illegal, but i dont want to work in those industries, and i dont think i am alone in my perspective. my view of work is that the business pays me for creating value, i want the business to get good value for money from me and want to keep working with me. that money comes from customers buying the product i produce, and i want the customer to get good value for money and repeat business. if the product isnt helpful, even if i can get money, it isnt good value for money and i dont like it.

section: flexible hours
businesses have regular needs, someone needs to mind the store. it is terribly convenient for businesses to ask their workers to work during fixed hours. it is convenient, but not actually that important for them. working long, fixed hours is very inconvenient for workers. sometimes different events, opportunities and accidents occur that make showing up to work at exact fixed times every day very difficult or at least not preferable. the work that most people do does not need to be done exactly between 0900 and 1700 monday to friday. its just that managers prefer that everyone work that way, and managers get to fire anyone that disagrees. it is much better for workers to get their work done when it is convenient for them, to make their schedule available to others, to be available sometimes for work communication when they arent otherwise working. the value the business receives is the value of the work you produce, which is all but totally unrelated to the number of hours you spend at work, depending on the kind of work you do. perhaps in manufacturing, production amount is related to time at work, and everyone needs to operate the factory together, so everyone needs to start and stop on time. but most people dont work in manufacturing, so time flexibility is warrented for most jobs.

section: flexible location
people work together the best when they are working together in one place. there is no social, cooperative substitute for in person interaction, the nuanced, embedded information we subconsciously collect from being on site and completing a project together. for high pressure, difficult, novel projects, the best results come from everyone working together at all hours on site, maybe even in one room. most of the work that people do is not high pressure, difficult, or novel, so they should be able to do most of their work wherever they want. there is usually some value in coming together sometimes or periodically, but demanding eight hours a day five days a week, or more, is silly in most cases. some people want everyone to have to come to an office because some people need to work in person. what kind of infantile sense of fairness is that? if your dog dies, do you have to kill my dog too? is that whats fair? different jobs have different requirements that suit different people and pay different wages, even at the same company.

section: supportive environment
some people want social connection at work, some people want to do their job in peace. what people do not want is petty gossip, office politics, cut throat competition, carelessness, hurtful criticism, aggression, bullying. they want to come to work and feel reasonably welcome, have the people around them make an effort to be professional and helpful, develop some level of teamwork even if not every person is great every time, thats workable.

section: explicit straightforward communication
corporate babble jargon obscurantism is a symptom of politics. the truth in companies doesnt sound nice, so they talk in a confusing way and lie so that they can sound good, in spite of doing things that dont sound good. sounding nice is a political advantage worth more for the manager than the confusion or displeasure of other parties, so they talk this way. corporate speak is a benefit for the manager but an overall cost for the company. many parts of business are not difficult to understand or communicate. managers gain an advantage by repackaging serious problems as nonexistant and gold plating successes over an honest, simple accounting of what is happening good and bad.

section: fair payment
in economic theory, companies should be unable to make a consistent profit, because other companies will enter the market, lower prices or pay workers more to get the best employees for themselves. in practice, there are various problems in the real world economy that means that some people are consistently over paid and others are consistently under paid. what workers want is to produce value for the company and get paid for a portion of the value they create. if they create more value, they deserve more money, and if they create less value, no value, or negative value, they should be paid less, get training, or be fired. workers do not like it when the company makes a lot of money and the executives, who decide their own compensation, decide to give themselves all the extra money, and dont give the workers any of the additional value they produced. there are all these bullshit little strategies where the company tries to save money on wages and hope the workers dont notice or dont have any better option. this is short sighted and ill advised. everyone is happy when the company creates increasing value in the market and shares the value in some proportion with the people who created the value, hopefully in some proportion with exactly who created more value.

section: opportunity
some workers just want to keep working and keep things the same. most workers want opportunities to improve, to take more responsibility within their ability, to create more value and earn more pay from the increasing value of their work to the company. many companies today dont offer much opportunity, so the primary way to progress in a career is to change companies every time you want to change positions, which is often bad for the company.

section: predictability or reliability
for many workers, just completing their job is difficult and stressful as it is. many companies make frequent and significant changes for little benefit without considering the costs for the workers. managers will frequently do reorgs to grasp organizational power, policies will change in confusing ways, people will move offices, and of course the elephant in the room is layoffs. getting a new job is so time consuming and unreliable that job volatility is a constant concern for most workers. for these reasons and more, many workers appreciate a fundamental stability in their employer. both sides should have a certain amount of flexibility, but workers appreciate consistency and reliability in their employer. of course changing market conditions make absolute consistency impossible, but well managed companies can provide a level of stability for their staff.

section: occupational therapy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy

chapter: positive vision of work
work sucks. imagine a wild future of work, even better than star trek. what if work was wonderful, but not a fantasy. what would work be like? would you have fixed working hours? no. would you have a boss? no, there would be a system to know what to do and people you could talk to about it. would you get paid every two weeks? no you would be paid in real time. would you have a fixed salary? no you would be paid based on what you produced. would you have to work for one company and send resumes and do interviews? no. finding the work you want to do would be easy. would the company make constant bone headed decisions? no, it would be capable and mission driven. would it matter if you have connections? no they would take the best person for the job. would you have to work fixed hours? no, sometimes you would spend a lot of your time working, other times you would focus on other things.

what do people want? income stability and predictability. monotonically increasing income. what do markets do? wildly fluctuating and unpredictable value creation. let people earn wildly fluctuating value, second party service that insures the income and annualizes it for say five years guaranteed at that amount or more.

section: games versus work
games and work are similar. both games and work have agents that take actions in an environment defined by a set of rules. some of the rules define an objective, so every agent has a score and we know the winner. both games and work require effort. both games and work can be challenging and encourage learning. this description applies to abstract games such as chess, physical games such as a foot race, abstract work such as accounting, and physical work such as construction. are games and work identical? no. and the difference is not money. there are people who do paid and unpaid work, and there are people who play games for fun and for money. one difference between games and work is whether losing is a problem. if you are playing a game, losing a hundred times can be a successful interaction with the game. at work, losing even once can be a big problem. a successful game is not a game where every player wins, a successful game is a game that players want to play. a failed game doesnt mean that players lose the game, a failed game is a game that players dont want to play. this is why one typical objective of games is to be fun. at work, success means creating value and getting paid. if you need more money, you will usually be willing to keep working, even if you dont enjoy it very much. at work, failure means not creating value or not getting paid. even if you want to keep doing it, you cant continue to work unpaid if you need money. this is why a typical objective of work is to make money. in games, there are effectively no consequences for losing, as long as its fun. at work, the consequences of losing are significant, because when you lose at work, you dont make money. losing is also failing to make money, a core objective for work.

those are some similarities and differences between games and work. is there anything we know about games that we can apply to work? there is a lot. people do better work if they like their job. even though you can pay someone to do something they dont like, if you can make the job more fun, people will do the job better or for less money, or both. employers often take little to no interest in the preferences and experiences of their workers. short sighted employers think, why do i have to say thank you? thats what the money is for! in fact, you dont have to say thank you, you can pay them more. but how much additional money can you earn by saying thank you, even though you dont have to? a lot.

section: how to make work more fun
eliminate or improve the parts of the job that the workers dislike the most, gamers call these quality of life improvements.
give explicit, accurate, immediate feedback. this is the game loop. people love to follow a game loop to success. inaccurate feedback causes failure, no feedback or delayed feedback causes no learning.
reward the behavior that you want and you will get more of it. people overreact to criticism and underreact to praise. reward in at least a three or more reward to one criticism ratio.
dont punish high performers. if someone wants to do more, allow them, encourage them, and reward high performance.
eliminate zero sum competition. the market isnt zero sum, there can be many winners. win lose situations promote antisocial strategies that make work aggressive, not fun.
written policies, statements, complex rules are ineffective. people dont listen to what you say, they see what you do. if you want your business to operate in a certain way, model it yourself, be consistent, show people the benefits. then other people will want to join in. many games have a tutorial, but most gamers dont want to read a lot of text. tutorials are often learn by doing, and they keep it short.
dont tell people exactly what to do. define a challenging and important goal and let them figure out how to achieve it. if you want to build a ship, dont drum up people and give orders. instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. part of what makes work traditionally unfun is you have to do what youre told. part of what makes games fun is that the player can do whatever they want within the rules. the way that people solve problems will surprise you. tell people exactly what to in specific cases, such as manufacturing, but otherwise dont.
experiment to reduce known risks. if you want to complete a project and know that the project has certain risks, start working on small scale experiements to solve the risky parts first. failure is acceptable and kind of fun, when you are experimenting. failure is not acceptable when you need to deliver the project. when you handle the risks to an acceptable level, everyone can work to complete the project with confidence. experimentation and failure is part of the fun of games, not usually part of work, but it should be.
dont make unnecessary demands. businesses frequently tell their workers to do all kinds of things that they dont actually need to do. nobody likes receiving pain, but doing something unpleasant to achieve an important goal is satisfying. pain without any purpose is the definition of suffering. suffering kills fun.
