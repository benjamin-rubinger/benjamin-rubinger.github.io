prediction markets are resilient https://x.com/NathanpmYoung/status/1832694333599785319

prediction markets are a proven method to make predictions and decisions that can reliably perform as well or better than any other known decision method such as experts, seniority, voting, dictatorship, debate, surveys, etc.

a prediction market is like a stock in the stock market. anyone can buy and sell shares in it. the market's value changes based only on the activity of buyers and sellers. prediction markets are unlike stock markets in that a stock market has one stock for one company, while prediction markets have many markets for one comapny. an individual prediction market represents a prediction about a specific, answerable question. the question must currently not have an answer, but we must be able to answer the question soon. we can use prediction markets to predict many things per company, and make decisions based on the predictions. the predictions will be as good or better than any other method, so the decisions based on them will be the best achievable decisions given the information available at that time.

for example, imagine we operate a retail store and we want to know, will it rain tomorrow? if it will rain, our store should display more umbrellas. if it will not rain, we should display more sunglasses. we open a prediction market. the question of the prediction market is, will it rain tomorrow? in our rain tomorrow prediction market, anyone can buy yes and no shares, until the time comes when we need to decide and act on our prediction. when its time to act, we close the market and prepare the store for the next day based on everyones predictions. the next day, it either rains or it doesnt and we learn the answer to the question, did it rain today? we resolve the market and pay the winners. this is different from a stock, because the prediction market closes and resolves instead of staying open. a prediction market is different from voting, because there is an objective answer to the question and the winners are not the majority, the winners are the participants that made correct predictions. what if no one wants to bet in a market? you can subsidize a market with an ante that contributes to the payout and attracts participants, pay for information.

prediction markets let you make better decisions than other decision methods because they allow anyone to participate and the markets pay participants for making accurate predictions. the incentive of a prediction market is to be accurate, unlike other methods. a prediction market allows people to put their money where their mouth is and incentivize people who know better. if they are right then they will be paid for contributing to an accurate prediction that can then be applied to make a useful decision. if they are wrong they will lose money to pay people who are right. over time, people who are wrong will either run out of money or learn from their errors to improve their predictions until they become right.

chapter: why dont companies use prediction markets?

applying prediction markets to company decisions would allow companies to make a lot lot lot more money. if companies want to make more money, why dont they use prediction markets? because companies have a fixed organizational and social structure that centralizes managers. the concept of a company is a hierarchy of managers over workers (org chart). managers make the decisions for the company. prediction markets are a tool that contradicts managers. managers have the authority to use or not use prediction markets. conventional companies will never use prediction markets. in order to apply prediction markets to business, we have to create a different organizational structure, companies without the conventional role of managers.

chapter: what are prediction market agents

prediction market agents is an organizational technology, a business in a box. it's a tool to help us work together, better. prediction market agents are companies that use prediction markets to make decisions. my goal with prediction market agents is to create an organizational process with better aligned incentives, creating organizations that more effectively pursue opportunities and accomplish their mission. the prediction market agent project will make it easy to form and operate these structurally different organizations. these organizations will avoid some of the typical inefficiencies of conventional companies from their inception. this is the only practical way for companies to adopt prediction markets, improve our economy, governance, society, way of life and allow a vibrant, hopeful future.

chapter: conventional companies
there are already various kinds of companies today, such as small businesses, multinational corporations and non-profits. i will call these conventional companies.

conventional companies today are better than earlier forms of organizations, yet there remain massive inefficiencies in conventional companies. companies often make avoidable bad decisions. they hire and fire the wrong people, invest in useless projects, squander their positive reputation, ignore market threats and opportunities, etc. what is incredible is that most of the time, there are people working in the company that know the company's mistakes and opportunities in advance, but have no way to act on them. why dont managers listen to their knowledgable colleagues? why dont conventional companies fix their inefficiencies and earn more profit? there are poorly aligned incentives in conventional companies that prevent them from eliminating these inefficiencies, even under competitive pressure from the market. employees can gain individual benefits at the company's expense until the company dies, then move to another company and do the same thing. conventional companies have poorly aligned incentives, so they often squander opportunities, fail their missions, and end up acquired or go out of business, the organizational life cycle.

chapter: guerilla capitalism

conventional institutions lose institutional capacity over time and need to be revitalized or replaced. incumbents resist change or replacement, they use their resources for regulatory capture and to erect barriers to entry. when incumbents are too strong, you get monopolies, oligoplies, corruption, social decay, black markets, lock in and a hopeless future. the symptoms of social decay are capital misallocation, falling labor force participation, falling birth rate. people want to create value, but when they are prevented from creating value in every way, they can only lash out or lay down to die. to break out of cycles of social decay, you need top down reform. top down reform is supposed to happen as needed, but does not happen when corruption reaches a critical level. top down reform of a corrupt organization requires bottom up support that overwhelms the control of the incumbents. bottom up support comes when someone develops a better way of doing things, people discover and experience it, and want more of it. i am attempting to develop a better way of doing things that anyone can try, a guerilla capitalism.

chapter: immature technology

this is a different way of doing business. whenever you look at a new paradigm from the point of view of the conventional paradigm, the new paradigm is plainly worse. between horses and cars, you can feed a horse some grass for free, but for cars you have to pay for gasoline. in this view, horses are better than cars. cars did replace horses for practical transport, because the car paradigm is overall better than the horse paradigm, even though you have to pay for gas.

the prediction market agent system looks very complicated, because i am explicitly modeling the activities of an entire economy. compared to the economy that you implicitly face every day, this system is very simple. you dont use a single system to model our conventional economy, so this system looks complicated compared to nothing.

this is alpha software. it doesnt look right, it doesnt work right, you will be unfamiliar with it. overall it sucks. every new technology starts off worse than the mature alternatives. the question is not, does this system suck right now? it does. we know that this version of the system is worse than the alternative. the question should be, would prediction market agents, if it is more developed and properly applied, would it be a better organizational system than conventional companies, or not?

like the rest of my projects, none of these ideas are new and people have tried similar things before. this project can succeed where others failed due to execution and timing.

for example, the crypto people are developing something called daos, decentralized autonomous organizations.

chapter: prediction market agents system
the prediction market agent system implements my proposed process for running an organization with prediction markets. here are some diagrams!

image: image/prediction%20market%20agents/basic.svg

image: image/prediction%20market%20agents/process.svg

image: image/prediction%20market%20agents/credit.svg

anyone can create agents. an agent can be either an individual or an organization. every agent is a company the same way that you are a person and can create a sole proprietorship. agents purchase items and services for consumption and offer items and services for sale. agents that create value earn points, a hypothetical currency. points can be earned in three ways.

make accurate predictions in prediction markets
fixed payment for work
credit for work, profit sharing

agents complete tasks, tasks complete projects, projects develop products, products create items, and sales of items transfer points that are distributed according to the credit. agents can specialize or operate in several different roles, including prediction (trade in prediction markets), planning (define tasks), work (complete tasks) and evaluation (review the work).

section: how do prediction market agents use prediction markets?
there are five standard prediction market topics. every project needs to predict
0 how valuable is it?
1 how much will it cost?
2 how long will it take?

for tasks
3 how valuable is it to the project?
4 how long will it take?

project benefit, cost, timeline. accurate predictions make easy decisions. the agent can pursue projects with the rank order highest predicted return on investment ratio. these predictions can change in real time, making the prioritization of projects responsive to changing conditions. some projects have time limitations, such as preparing to sell sweaters before the winter, so the timeline prediction is necessary to decide timing.

all five of these topics provide critical predictions that support algorithmic decisions using all of the available information. crucially, all five of these questions have objective answers that can be resolved in a reasonable amount of time. if we propose or start working on a project today, we dont know how much money it will potentially earn, how much it will cost to complete, or how long it will take. on the day that we complete the project, we will know how long it took and how much it cost to that point. some time after we deliver a project, we will be able to estimate its revenue.

how do we measure how valuable a task is to a project? you can do a project replication without that task, or create a fork of the product without the result of that task, and measure how much that task omission changes the value of the product.

apart from the standard five topics, agents can create prediction markets on any topic to make policy decisions. should an agent be granted or revoked a privilege, should we increase or decrease prices on a product, etc. these prediction markets need individual designs to resolve them accurately. a/b tests, replicating work, independent evaluators or experiments are needed to resolve the markets.

for hiring
over the course of a year, how much credit will this person earn in this role?
what will be the average work quality index for this persons work? work quality index is latency * work quality

chapter: why not build a prediction market platform? why does prediction market agents do all that other stuff?

if the essential difference between conventional companies and prediction market agents is prediction markets, why not develop a prediction market platform that anyone and any company can use to create their own prediction markets as needed? why does prediction market agents need to do anything else, like project management or sales, when there are already many tools available to perform these functions? what do those functions have to do with prediction markets?

the answer is that the technology of prediction markets is well known, proven effective and available to businesses, but remains unused. there are several prediction market platforms, and it is not difficult to build your own prediction market platform if you choose.

knowing all this, the question is, why dont conventional businesses adopt and use prediction markets? dont they want to make money?

robin hanson claims that we dont need generic prediction market platforms that could be applied to any business, what we need for conventional businesses to adopt prediction markets is specialized prediction market tools that provide prediction market applications, ready to use and supported turnkey solutions for existing businesses. when engineers developed the technology of the steam engine, it was an interesting idea but it may have been hard for others to apply that idea to their business. no one knew how to manufacture, operate or maintain steam engines. only when new steam engine companies developed specialized steam engine based products or services for pumping water out of mines, then the steam engine industry begin to develop. robin advocates for creating similarly specialized prediction market applications to allow companies to buy a prediction market product with a specific application and a defined benefit, such as hiring prediction markets.

companies could buy a hiring prediction market tool where interviewers could predict, at the time of an interview, what the future employee review scores for candidates would be after one year of employment. the candidates with the highest predicted employee review scores would be hired. one year later they would complete their annual review and the prediction market could resolve. interviewers with higher employee prediction accuracy would earn money, giving interviewers an incentive to calibrate and help the company hire better employees. win win win!

hiring today is very expensive and error prone for businesses, and conventional businesses already spend a lot of money on products and services for hiring. are there no companies that can figure out how to use existing prediction market platforms to make their own hiring prediction markets and get better employees today? i think there are smart, talented, ambitious people at many companies that are already informed and capable to do prediction market hiring.

i disagree with robin hanson that the missing link for conventional companies to adopt prediction markets is turnkey solutions. i think the reason that conventional companies have not adopted prediction markets is not any difficulty or confusion about prediction markets themselves. i think the managers of conventional companies understand the potential applications and benefits of prediction markets well enough. the reason conventional companies persistently and universally refuse prediction markets is that the managers do not want to adopt prediction markets. prediction markets can help the company, but prediction markets harm the interests of managers. the interests of the company and the manager as an individual do not align. this is the principal agent problem. if a manager wants to hire their friend but the hiring prediction market predicts that their friend is not the best choice, they cant hire their friend. if a manager wants to increase the headcount of their team but the prediction market predicts that a larger team would not create a corresponding increase in revenue, then they cant increase the size of their team. if a manager wants to start a project that makes them look good but the prediction market predicts that this project would have a negative return on investment, then they cant do their project. part of a manager's job is to make decisions. prediction markets make predictions, which potentially, or even usually, disagree with the manager's decision. managers are unilaterally able to decide whether to adopt prediction markets. which manager would choose to adopt a tool that will disagree with their decisions? no manager. none. prediction markets are persistently, universally rejected by managers of conventional companies.

conclusion. it is difficult to convince a manager to adopt prediction markets when their salary depends on not adopting prediction markets.

the only way for companies to adopt prediction markets is to form different kinds of companies without conventional managers. how can you operate a company without managers? you need new roles in the organization and tools fulfill all the roles that managers perform. the prediction market agents system has so many features beyond prediction markets because these features allow agents to coordinate to operate a business where the conventional role of managers is replaced by specialized roles like planners and evaluators, while decisions are made using prediction markets.

the prediction market agent system also handles things like tasks and sales to integrate the business operations with the prediction markets, assisting with creating, participating in and resolving prediction markets.

chapter: the principal agent problem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principal-agent_problem

the principal agent problem is a special term to describe a universal human problem. no person is an island, people depend on other people to meet their needs. other people do the work that i dont have the resources or ability to do myself. i need to drive places but i dont have the equipment or the know how to maintain or repair my car. on the surface this is a perfect situation, i can specialize my work to what i do best and society needs most, everyone else can do the same, and we can all help each other. but a car mechanic has power over their customers. the mechanic has special knowledge that the customer does not have, and the mechanic can use their knowledge to defraud the customer for the mechanics benefit. the mechanic can claim that a car needs an expensive service that the car does not require. the customer may not know whether the mechanic's claims are true or not, and taking the car to another mechanic for a second opinion also costs time and money. the cause of this problem is that mechanics are commonly paid per service and can earn more money by performing more services, even when those services are fraudulent. if you paid your mechanic a retainer instead, a continuous fee for keeping the car working, then the mechanic would have an incentive aligned with the customer to minimize services while keeping the car working. this is a fundamental difference between pay for work and pay for result. pay for work increases the principal agent problem, and pay for result reduces the principal agent problem.

managers in conventional companies are the first example listed in the wikipedia article about the principal agent problem for good reason. managers limit communication between every party in a conventional company, create maximum information asymmetry, the role of managers creates a terrible principal agent problem. managers can deceive everyone, their own team members, other teams and upper management. manager performance is difficult to measure objectively, allowing corruption of feedback and collusion. manager roles have power and authority over other people, attracting power hungry sociopaths, politicians, cheats and liars. managers are paid in proportion to the number of employees in their team, giving managers a perverse incentive to increase headcount and power grab. we need to do a reorg! parasitic managers can make an endless stream of false claims, increase narrow metrics in the short term while sacrificing the future potential of the comapny to achieve its overall mission, claim victory, then run to another position or another company and sound the horn of their own triumphs, while the previous company loses potential growth, which is difficult to measure.

managers are political, so they are anti mertiocratic and pro bureaucratic. bureaucracy is self serving, the bureaucracy is growing to meet the growing needs of the bureaucracy.

capable people should be successful in theory, but capable people are often unsuccessful in practice. this is partially because of the saying, its not what you know, its who you know. this expression describes that political connections are more important than results. if we reduce the principal agent problem in companies, then the saying will revert to the common sense nonpolitical version, its not who you know, its what you know.

choosing reliable, honest, capable, mission driven managers is a successful strategy. but now the incentive for nefarious agents is to find a way to deceive you to appear reliable, honest, capable and mission driven when they are not, like politicians. until now, we have not found a way to eliminate the principal agent problem of managers in conventional companies.

chapter: replacing conventional managers
a conventional manager concentrates many roles into one person. in my experience, a manager is responsible for the following garbage bin of responsibilities that individually might not be difficult, but it is rare to find one person that does all or most of these well simultaneously.

list of responsibilities of conventional managers
hiring workers, including job listings, interviews, negotiations, onboarding
administration
scheduling of projects, meetings, work hours, vacations
budgeting and resource allocation
define tasks
assign tasks, reassign tasks, cancel tasks
coordinate tasks with other teams
check progress
report progress
evaluate work
allocate credit
evaluate workers
compensation negotiation
assign or conduct worker training
worker coaching
make or oversee team decisions
monitor, adjudicate and enforce policy
performance improvement and firing workers
receive and implement directives from upper management
communicate between the organization and their team
receive, coordinate and resolve problems about their team
receive, coordinate and resolve problems from workers
advocate on behalf of the company to the workers
advocate on behalf of the workers to the company
shift blame from themselves to others

create process, such as how work gets done

managers are often highly paid, self important, micro managing or checked out. the relationship between the worker and their manager is the largest factor in worker satisfaction, meaning it is likely that if i love my job then i love my boss, or if i hate my job then i hate my boss. a process such as scrum can shift some of the responsibilities from the software team manager to the team, such as task definition, task assignment and scheduling. but most companies and teams that say they do scrum dont really do it and degenerate back towards manager command and control.

managers do not want to use prediction markets, so if we want to use prediction markets then we need to replace managers with new roles that have aligned incentives. all of this work that managers are supposed to do needs to be reallocated to new roles in the organization. instead of managers evaluating tasks, specialized evaluators or workers evaluate each others tasks, like we do with code review in software development. instead of managers planning tasks, specialized planners or workers plan their own work, like scrum proposes to do. instead of your manager deciding credit, everyone involved evaluates credit and the algorithm resolves it. instead of the manager making decisions, prediction markets make decisions.

workers complete tasks to implement projects based on policy changes, policy changes come from prediction markets
communicate between the organization and their team
typical communication channels, chatrooms, email, wiki, social media, gossip. rumors quashed or validated by prediction markets, put up or shut up
receive, coordinate and resolve problems about their team
conventional error handling systems such as customer support, prioritization by prediction market, tasks completed by workers
receive, coordinate and resolve problems from workers
insider problems handled the same way as outsider problems
advocate on behalf of the company to the workers
no need to advocate, elimination of politics, use prices and prediction markets to decide
advocate on behalf of the workers to the company
flxible workforce allows workers to advocate with their feet. prediction markets can change policy for mutual benefit.
shift blame from managers to others
its impossible to blame something that doesnt exist :)

section: this process looks heavy and complex

it is a lot of boring repetitive extra work to track all this activity. you can use less granular, bigger tasks to do less reporting. also repetitive actions can eventually be automated so the extra work will eventually go to zero. also this tracking is not wasteful. it provides these specific valuable benefits that are worth far more than the process effort. if the process effort isnt worth the benefits then you may be blind to the benefits or this process is not appropriate for your application.

all of this is making explicit work that is already done explicitly, implicitly, or work that people agree should be done, but often isnt. for example, task definition is sometimes done, but is often skipped. managers prefer workers that know what to do without asking. a shared, implicit understanding of priorities and procedure saves a lot of work and improves efficiency. but when problems or changes inevitably occur, there is no paper trail or established communication to rely on, leading to larger losses. it is also easier for the manager to blame the worker when the work is implicit. the work to define tasks is often skipped when everyone should agree that it is beneficial. if we eliminate the option of implicit work, we also reduce the tendency for hierarchy. task definition, task completion and task evaluation are all just work. someone else might define tasks for you to define, then you define them, and a third person evaluates your tasks.

chapter: why conventional companies dont use prediction markets
why do conventional companies avoid prediction markets?
is it because conventional companies have not heard about prediction markets? no. the information about prediction markets has been available for decades.
are prediction markets expensive or difficult to try? no. the cost to try prediction markets is affordable for many organizations, and they have been trialed several times.
do prediction markets only work in theory, and they dont work in practice? companies have tried prediction markets in practice. when companies tried prediction markets with an appropriate methodology, they found that prediction markets work in practice.
for example, google operated an internal employee only prediction market service for several months, and then closed it down. the markets worked as described.

why do conventional companies avoid prediction markets? because prediction markets make decisions! there are already people employed at conventional companies as decision makers, the executives. the executives want to keep doing what they are already doing, they do not want to be replaced or overruled by prediction markets. executives also have the authority to decide whether to use prediction markets or not. executives unanimously choose to not use prediction markets. it is very hard to convince someone to use a tool when their salary depends on their not using it. that is why conventional companies avoid prediction markets.

there is no practical, technical or legal reason to avoid prediction markets. as a decision making tool, prediction markets can be state of the art. existing businesses are showing us that there are strong incentives for executives to avoid using prediction markets.

chapter: how can we change the incentives to favor using more effective methods?
organizations typically calcify around a particular way of doing business and resist many kinds of change. i propose that the only way to change the incentives to use these or other unconventional methods is to form new competitive organizations that operate using these methods from the beginning. the improved methods will give a new company an advantage over an incumbant. now the incentives favor using more effective methods. either the incumbant will respond to even the advantage, such as by adopting prediction markets, or the new company will take market share away from the incumbant and profit.

draw out the open company diagram for closed loop processes. maybe separately describe differences in labor market dynamics between an open and conventional company.

chapter: the ideal and the reality of conventional companies

there are good people who act responsibly everywhere. good people that follow the rules, find effective ways to solve problems, act in the best interests of themselves, the company, the community and the environment. it is equally true that there are bad people everywhere too, they are irresponsible, violate the rules, act selfish or ideologically and harm the company, the community, the environment, and often themselves. there is a third kind of person, the mediocre majority of people. they are incapable, ineffective, muddled, short sighted, disinterested. they cant make new ideas, cant complete difficult projects or tasks, allow bad people to do what they want, and prevent good people from acting. the typical conventional company collects mediocre people, protects bad people, crushes good people, forgets its mission and fails out of the market (the conclusion of the business cycle). the goal of a prediction market agent is to filter out the mediocre people, crush the bad people, protect the good people and fulfill its mission using market forces.

conventional companies are a mixture of functional and dysfunctional dynamics. in some companies at some times, things work how they are supposed to work and things go well. at other times, things dont work how they are supposed to work for many reasons.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilbert
the comic strip dilbert is a parody of office work, like the movie office space and the tv show, the office. these media are famous partly due to funny jokes, but they are mainly famous because no matter how ridiculous the situation they portray, real life events found a way to make them look like an unbiased and unremarkable documentary.

grid2:
how companies are supposed to work
how companies typically work
profitable company needs to hire more staff to meet growing market demand or to enter a new part of the market
unprofitable company hires more staff to increase the number of employees under a manager to make them look more important, use an allocated budget, add staff to try to speed up a project behind schedule
hiring manager writes accurate job description. includes required skills and qualities, work environment, department, team, typical work for the position and pay range. the post is up for a week or two and removed immediately after enough applicantions have been received.
someone copies and maybe modifies an existing and inaccurate job description. word salad. listed required skills are irrelevant, actual required skills are not listed. required experience is overstated. no mention of what the work will be, or the team listed is inaccurate. no pay range included, it is inaccurate or open to negotiation. job listings stay open, unfilled for months or years.
qualified applicants apply with accurate information customized to the job requirements.
applications flood in but most of the applications are so inaccurate that they could be called fraudulent. recruiters looking for a large commision submit inaccurate applications on behalf of job seekers.
after a few days of collecting applications, the hiring manager selects several of the most promising applicants and interviews them briefly to confirm their qualifications and see if they can work together. they shortly make a decision and negotiate the details with the selected applicants for a straightforward hire. employee starts in a probationary period and leaves quickly if it doesnt work out. 
extended interview process that takes weeks or months to schedule and conclude. phone screen, work sample, skills interview, behavioral interviews, meet the team, meet the manager, salary negotiation, offer letter, background check, first day. applicants are rejected at any time, sometimes silently, and without feedback.
company offers the job with payment at the market rate for the applicant's skills in their industry
company offers lowest payment they think the applicant will accept. employees are paid different amounts for the same job even with similar qualifications and similar performance. if an applicant can arrange multiple job offers simultaneously, they can entice the companies to bid against each other and increase their offers.
applicant takes an appropriate amount of time to consider the offer of employement
offer letter expires in 24 hours to prevent applicants from shopping offers and renegotiating
applicant soon becomes a new employee and starts learning their new job on their first day. their new team helps train the new employee in addition to adequate information, facilities and opportunity. they are quickly able to participate. if for any reason they arent able to contribute, they quit or are fired.
company isnt ready for the employee to start for weeks, their new employee introduction takes over a week before they can start learning their job. the employee mostly has to figure out their job for themselves with inadequate information, facilities, opportunity or support. if they arent able to contribute, it takes months or longer to fire them.
the team works together to complete the most work with the highest quality
employees do as little as possible, defend their position, or try to get the most prestigious work to raise their position
the team manager helps to plan and deliver the most work with the highest quality while promoting the development of the team members. takes responsibility for problems and helps resolve them within the team and across teams. delegates as much as possible to the people doing the work.
the team manager micromanages, plays favorites, or checks out. they gate keep, all communication must channel through the manager who shifts blame and makes their team look shiny to everyone else. all time spent in meetings and reporting to upper management.
the company network has relevant and accurate information, timely communication
the wiki has no documentation about major projects, and outdated information when present. email comes frequently but is not informative or urgent, but sometimes someone expects you to reply immediately so you have to check frequently. slack has hundreds of channels with chatter, confusion and drama. employees receive frequent notifications with low signal to noise, but high cost of not checking.
meetings are scheduled to solve problems with specific groups of employees. organizers prepare materials in advance and participants arrive on time and prepared to discuss the problem. during the meeting, participants join or leave the meeting depending on whether they are needed. the group works to understand the problem and come to a decision with the right level of risk as quickly as possible, produces a record of the problem, their conclusions and the decision. by the end of the meeting every participant knows what they need to do to take the next step to resolve the problem.
regular meetings happen with large groups to report status to a manager or for a manager to announce information to the employees. these are always a waste, because reporting can happen asynchronously. people come to meetings unprepared and do not take the time in the meeting to prepare. necessary people are not present in the meeting, and unnecessary people remain in the meeting. people make decisions and no one knows why afterward. if the decision is wrong, you are unsure if the original decision maker knew something that you dont. if the decision is right, you might reverse it for a mistaken reason that they previously avoided.
employees receive raises and promotions as their productivity increases and their pay adjusts to the market. employees can occasionally change teams to help where needed, work with specific colleagues or learn new skills.
pushy employees get raises and quiet employees dont. employers dont promote their employees, so employees change companies to advance. managers keep employees in the same role for years or shift them to other teams as convenient to them. managers fire the most experienced employees to save money.
the product team researches customers and the market, monitors products, explores opportunities and prioritizes the most valuable work for the companys success
product team chases individual contracts, copies competitors, ignores customer benefit and doesnt create value
management keeps track of the state of the company and the market to lead the company to continuous success
management shifts blame, takes credit, grows budget and headcount for personal success at the expense of the company
employees of different departments work together to make the company successful. all employees try to make improvements and managers consider all proposals. good ideas can come from anywhere.
keep your head down, the manager knows best, do what i told you, command and control, competition between departments, the right hand doesnt know what the left hand is doing
only do work within the company core competence. buy competitive products and services outside the core competence.
not built here syndrome
share information about everything you do that is not the core competency or market advantage of the company to allow suggestions or share best practices. everyone benefits.
everything proprietary, nobody benefits and no criticism.
complete projects that create value and maintain them to continue to create value and create more value with improvements. allow anyone with the skills and interest to improve the system.
develop, abandon, exclude. solve the immediate problem with a system, prevent anyone from touching the working system. focus on the next problem and abandon the system until it breaks and becomes the problem again.

chapter: incentives

one typical incentive for work is pay. other incentives include camaraderie, the development and expression of mastery and the joy of being useful to others. for some people having an occupation is a way to escape other parts of their life. if someone isnt distracted by work, they will pursue other distractions including time wastes and addictions.

commission is pay for result. if i make 10 widgets, you pay me one coin per widget so you pay me 10 coins. the worker is exposed to all the complexity and risk. efficiency is the workers problem, the buyer can pay a flat amount per widget. this is one of the most effective methods of payment. one downside is that externalities are hard to internalize without monitoring. this method is hard to apply to most jobs. widgets might be a commodity, but what about the people who maintain the widget machines or the people who answer phone calls? evaluating their results is harder to define. you could pay for operational machine hours or phone calls completed, but how to incentivise preventative maintenance, or customer satisfaction? pay for result should be the standard payment method, i think we should face the difficulty of evaluating the value of work.

subsection: hourly wage
an hourly wage pays for time. if a worker shows up to the factory and is available to make widgets but the widget machine needs unscheduled maintenance that day, the worker wouldnt make any money from commissions even though they were ready to work. the problem is the employer didnt have reserved widget machines or hired too many widget workers. one solution is to pay the worker for their work hours, and then even if they make different numbers of widgets in a day they will be paid the same. now the number of widgets produced per worker is the employer's concern, not the workers, so the workers can have stable income and do their best while the employer has the incentive to increase the widgets per worker. this method has several silly consequences, rigid work schedules that dont accomodate changing circumstances, drag ass and make work to spend more hours, favoritism and bullying by cutting scheduled hours, myopic pursuit of metrics while ignoring quality or other hard to quantify dimensions that also contribute to value. focusing on whether a worker is sitting in a chair for a certain number of hours rather than what the worker produces is horrible.

for specialist labor such as lawyers or mechanics, charging an hourly rate allows them to offer their specialized services to the market with the ability to give price estimates before starting work. they can offer their services to the wide market for anyone who needs them and can afford their rate. their customers are typically non specialists, so the incentive is to commit fraud and claim more hours than they spent. in the other direction, if the client has a maximum price they can afford and the project goes over budget, which can easily happen even to capable and experienced experts, the project can fail, the client can be dissatisfied at paying much more than quoted, or the specialist can be underpaid for their labor.

subsection: salary
salary work is pay for time in a loose way. it is hard to estimate worker value or productivity, so a salary worker is expected to work at least a certain number of hours per week at certain times of day, but they are paid a fixed salary no matter the exact number of hours that they work. they do not need to account for every minute of their time. managers form a general opinion of the workers productivity but this kind of work is difficult to quantify. often the manager can only really compare employees against each other, i get more value from this employee over that one, or this employee has a skill that none of the other employees can replace. the employer has the advantage over the employees by secretly negotiating individual salaries with each employee and offering them the minimum salary that they think the employee will accept. due to increased employee turnover, employees can now get higher salaries by changing to jobs with better pay. on the other hand, the interview process is so expensive and job offers are so inconsistent that i think employers maintain a significant advantage with salaries. i am against pay for time.

subsection: tenure
essentially unconditional pay. a tenure position is paid a fixed salary with very low work requirements and is hard to terminate. tenure is almost a job for life. most people would exploit a job with high pay and low requirements to take the money and do nothing. why would anyone offer a job with tenure? the goal of offering a job with tenure is to identify highly capable and self motivated people and support them to do what they wanted to do anyway, especially if you can not know what they need to do in advance. this method is only proven successful in special areas such as research. research is exploratory, expensive and difficult, but the benefits from discoveries can be worth the risks. it is sometimes profitable to pay people to do whatever they want, but only in special circumstances and with special people. tenure is not a good payment method for work in general.

subsection: stock based compensation
pay for indirect company profit. many employees receive some form of stock based compensation, and some executives receive only stock based compensation. in theory the stock price of a company is the market's best estimate of the companies future earnings. if an individual employee can significantly contribute to increase the companys future profits, then the stock price will increase and that employee will receive a percentage of the value they created. in a limited way this is an ideal form of payment for results. in practice, stock prices swing wildly in the short and even the medium term due to many factors including macroeconomic swings that do not reflect company or individual creation of value, called irrationality. the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvant. the longer term trends that the theory promises are typically smashed in practice with an insane obsession with quarterly numbers that have little to do with creating value. in my own experience of stock based compensation, i was offered slowly vesting stock options that i needed to pay for myself in a complex and pointless procedure that was more of an expensive hassle than a form of payment. in theory i support stock based compensation but in practice it is usually counterproductive, wasteful and unreactive. even if someone creates value, they may receive stock compensation years later and depending on how they execute it or due to market conditions they may earn nothing or even lose money.

chapter: camaraderie
humans are social animals, we need interaction with other people to thrive. solitary confinement is considered the worst punishment for criminals because it deprives them of social interaction. one of the benefits of work in an organization is camaraderie, camaraderie includes these joys
- working with other people to achieve a shared objective
- being needed by someone else
- being able to fulfill other peoples needs
- fulfilling other peoples needs
- trusting other people
- being trusted
- combined efforts achieving something you could not do by yourself
- maybe a separate section about being useful

chapter: skills, experience, mastery
one of the benefits of work is developing your skills. as a child you develop skills for your potential future, because other people tell you to, or for fun. in industry you provide a service and you have the repeated opportunity to satisfy customers. the feedback of finding and satisfying customers is the most real and reliable feedback available, except for logical truth. practice with feedback is the most effective way to develop skills, and greater skill produces greater value in the market. there is a joy in growth and a joy in creating value.

chapter: belonging, group identity, filling a role, doing it for someone else


chapter: negative incentives

section: hierarchy, dominance, self esteem, dark triad narcissism machiavellianism psychopathy
narcissism is characterized by grandiosity, pride, egotism, and a lack of empathy.
machiavellianism is characterized by manipulation and exploitation of others, indifference to morality, lack of empathy, and a strategic focus on self-interest.
psychopathy is characterized by continuous antisocial behavior, impulsivity, selfishness, callous and unemotional traits, and remorselessness.

section: zero sum competition
the company has an annual budget allocated among several departments
only one person can be in charge

section: short term vs long term
quarterly numbers
myopic metrics

chapter: idiots, 10x engineers, software engineering
the eighty twenty rule appears in organizations, where approximately 80% of the work is completed by 20% of the workers. this means that a few people are good at their jobs, and almost everyone else contributes relatively little, they are almost irrelevant, and sometimes counter productive. finding great people is difficult, great people are rare, idiots are everywhere. this is a huge problem. there arent enough great people to do all the work that we need to do. what should society do with all the idiots, the people who arent very productive at any job? how do you collect the great people? how do you keep the idiots out of the important positions, but also find a way to allow the idiots to produce the maximum value that they are capable of? we must make it as easy as possible for anyone to try any job and demonstrate their objective competence. this would probably include career agents, people who are good at determining and matching people with their competence and specific jobs. we cant predict every loser that could suddenly produce a towering work of creative genius, but established and repeatable jobs should be possible. we should be meritocratic, we should align incentives so that people who produce the most value get the most rewards and encourage them to find the most valuable work they can do and do the most work that they can. sometimes this might mean an intense work focus for some period of time, and it might also mean a very pleasant work life balance at other times.

corporate babble jargon obscurantism is a political symptom. the truth in companies doesnt sound nice, so they talk in a confusing way and lie so that they can sound good, in spite of doing things that dont sound good. sounding nice is a political advantage worth more for the manager than the confusion or displeasure of other parties, so they talk this way. corporate speak is a benefit for the manager but an overall cost for the company. many parts of business are not difficult to understand or communicate. managers gain an advantage by repackaging problems as nonexistant and gold plating successes over an honest, simple accounting of what happened good and bad.

job description inaccurate and asks for requirements they don't need and skips requirements they do need
resume circular file excludes qualified applicants 
interview has many filters that are irrelevant to job performance 
they choose which team and projects you work on
they want you to work more than 40 hours a week often at a fixed location at fixed times
hr compliance training and political ideology review processes quotas exclude people who don't conform and aren't political even though it's unrelated to job performance and prevents employees from working

secret of my success memes, you want experience but how can i get experience if you won't give me a job? i can be anything you need. can you be a minority woman?

good ideas can come from anywhere but i ignore everything except my own ideas

how companies typically work

i want a future of abundance. competitive markets efficiently allocate resources to produce the most beneficial products and services. competitive markets and technological progress create abundance. abundance is incompatible with astronomical waste. efficient governance and superior decision making processes are necessary for the abundant future. we have everything we need to create abundance but we are not. the systems we are using have misaligned incentives. i have designed this system to better align the incentives of all participants and help to realign our society to realize our abundant potential that is currently being squandered. who gave you permission to disrupt my society. our joyous future children are begging me to help them exist.

no resume just look at their chart of created value and what they did to create it

companies are incentivized to reduce competition. competition reduces profit. the prediction market agent project reduces the cost to compete.

the company is a family wtf

most psychological work on human irrationality and self deception is based on the you cant handle the truth model, which is greatly inferior to the truth is often disadvantageous in social games involving persuasion, reputation management, and social signaling model.

i am describing this project in words here for your reference, but i have implemented the prediction market agent concept as open-source software and you can create your own prediction market agents right now using my free service to experience it for yourself.

conventional companies are not all bad and prediction market agents are not all good. in some situations, a conventional company will produce the better results and in other situations a prediction market agent will produce better results.

section: exclusion and openness
a prediction market agent is similar to the combination of a conventional company and an open-source software project. in a conventional company only authorized employees can perform the work. in an open-source software project and with a prediction market agent, anyone can do work. in a conventional company, only the executives make the decisions, excluding everyone else. in an open source project, typically the core team makes the decisions, excluding everyone else. if the executives or the core team make bad decisions, the organization might lose market share or even terminate, or someone might start a competitor or a fork to make different decisions. openness is not a binary question. openness is a continuum, so an organization can be more or less open in different ways at different times.


do you know what a prediction market is?
anarchy - form of society without rulers. stateless society of voluntary free association.
minarchy - limited and minimal state that enforces nonaggression using the military, police and courts, protecting the public from aggression, theft, breach of contract, fraud, and enforcing property laws.
prediction market - open market that enables the prediction of specific outcomes using financial incentives. exchange-traded markets established for trading bets in the outcome of various events. the market price can indicate what the crowd thinks the probability of the event is.
futarchy - elected officials define measures of national wellbeing, and prediction markets are used to determine which policies will have the most positive effect.
libertarian - maximize autonomy and political freedom, emphasizing equality before the law and civil rights to freedom of association, freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom of choice. libertarians are often skeptical of or opposed to authority, state power, warfare, militarism and nationalism.
describe a project that you and your team is working on right now


theres been peer reviewed scholarship on this and the finding is that prediction markets are considerably more accurate than peer reviewed scholarship. https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1746358217095946390

lets hire professional management. we hired a bunch of professional managers, it didnt work at all. most of them were bozos. they knew how to manage, but they didnt know how to do anything. if youre a great person, why do you want to work for somebody you cant learn anything from? you know who the best managers are? they are the great individual contributors who never ever want to be a manager but decide they have to be a manager because no one else will be able to do as good a job as them. steve jobs https://twitter.com/historyinmemes/status/1758794667993260057

the one thing i learned from both robin hanson and trying to implement prediction markets at work is that, unless youre completely surrounded by gigautists, no one actually wants a feedback mechanism that has a chance to say the leadership is doing a bad job. https://twitter.com/seconds_0/status/1760353986501386708

john carmacks review of the book bullshit jobs https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1796622337963389412
bullshit jobs 2018 david graeber https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs
productivity gains have neither reduced work hours nor expanded work scope in proportion. instead we create bullshit jobs. today maybe half of jobs are bullshit. bullshit jobs do not produce value even though they may be well paid with low requirements. companies create bullshit jobs for managerial feudalism and a puritan capitalist view that we have a duty to work forty hours a week or more, whether its productive or not. going to work seems is performative suffering. competition has not punished wasteful spending. corporate managers are feudal lords that increase headcount and hold all hands meetings to increase prestige, not revenue. when people need meaning from their work, bullshit jobs create profound psychological violence and a scar on our collective soul. 

regulatory capture and lawfare protects incumbants and large companies from competition, entrepreneurs, stifles progress and productivity

obstructionists, interceders, rent seekers, freedom of association, freedom of contract, freedom of money, enforcement, defiance

the self interests of the institutions grow to become obstructionist and parasitize the producers. the large established institutions dominate and smother entrepreneurs. the institutions need to be reformed back to allowing economic and social growth, or the institutions must be countered by powerful opposition, or the power of the instution must be dissolved by operating outside of their domain.

duplicate work, redundency, comparison in unique projects, dissimilar redundancy, training, evaluation, competition

what is the total addressable market for business process innovation? the total market.

pournelles iron law of bureaucracy. while any institution may begin with the majority of its members working for the stated goals, over time, the institution will be dominated more and more by people whose sole concern will be the perceived status of the organization.

productivity is resistance!

right now is the time where we have the greatest productive capacity. we should almost all be rich compared to the people of the past. for example, we are now swimming in information that was previously rare and expensive. the latest electronics are more affordable than before. but some essential commodities are increasingly expensive and take up more and more of our spending, such as housing, health care and food. why arent these commodities plentiful and becoming cheaper too? wheres the biotech? wheres the high speed trains? wheres the innovation? market interference.

career agents vs recruiter scum

opponents
scammers - the prince of nigeria needs you to send money to this bank account. the country of nigeria will later repay you a thousandfold! you can get rich quick! send this request to three of your friends so they can get rich too!
frauds - i am an expert in this field. pay me in advance for my expert consultation and you will be glad you did!
spies - i claim to be unaffiliated and over time i became one of your best workers or colleagues. i secretly work for another organization to achieve their mission, not your mission.
turncoats - i was originally neutral or positive towards this agent and we worked together, but now i want to attack this agent. 
trolls - i am willing to spend a lot of time and effort to attack this agent, for my own amusement.
sociopaths - i am willing to do anything to gain fame and power for myself.
politicians - i say and do whatever will get people to like me and give me power.
incumbants - this agent is competing with me for market share and i have a lot of resources to use to attack.

you cant let random people on the internet run your business. they are not trustworthy. they will steal, sabotage, be incompetent and incoherent. what is the most serious threat to conventional companies? is it criminals, competitors, suppliers? the most serious threat to a conventional company is their own employees. trusted employees is a convenient dream. this is a structural problem that can only be mitigated by changing the way companies operate. much higher transparency, separation of concerns, more process, more oversight, better aligned incentives including credit, bonds, vouching and bounties, escalating trust, granular access control, prediction market decision making.

daily standup is potentially great, but has never achieved its potential in my experience. it devolves into a daily report to the manager. people dont see the value in it. they blather. they are disorganized and talk about things the rest of the team doesnt care about. they dont update other team members about discoveries or decisions. they hide blockers.

ive heard people say, listen, hes an out of the box thinker, hes a businessman, hes an entrepreneur, but people that know you say...im not really a businessman. youre not a businessman? no. what are you? im sure there are lots of analysts on wallstreet who agree that im not a businessman. ok, well what do you think you are? im an engineer. i like engineering and design. but youre not a businessman? i dont look at things from like, whats the rank ordered list of priorities based on return on investment. i dont really do any investments. i only own one public security, and thats tesla. i have no diversity in terms of public securities. https://x.com/historyinmemes/status/1816961695081812096
elon in fact talks frequently about prioritizing based on return on investment, only from the perspective of long time horizons, the survival and thriving of the human race over thousands of years. what is the kind of future that you want, what is exciting. elon rejects not rank ordered lists based on return on investment, but focusing on short time horizons, the myopic view of wall street analysts.

how can we become responsive and innovative to changing conditions, eliminate bullshit work and middle managers, allocate work to capable people, allow workers to choose when, where and what they work on, circumvent suffocating regulation?

does hiring select the best person for the job? is it efficient in time or cost? do salaries match value created? do people enjoy their work? do companies produce value for society and make the world better? do people work closely with their coworkers, do they respect their boss?

conventional companies that offer gig work platforms is part of the vision, but in practice there is a narrow or modular corporate function that preserves the core of the problem. it gives workers flexibility, but often uses deceptive tactics to extort revenue through things such as special promotions and tips.

people who work well together create value, mutually recognize the value that the other provides and agree about the credit the other earns or overallocates credit to the other person. people that underallocate credit to the other person do not recognize the value the other provides. they are saying that they dont want to work together. when people work together, create value and agree or overallocate credit to the other, they want to work together again. when people work together and they dont create value or they underallocate credit, they do not want to work together again. taking all the credit yourself, when others disagree, is a way to reject yourself from a work group. inaccurate self effacing credit, no you, no you, doesnt reward performance and lowers the competitiveness of the group, is a way to reject the work group from the market.

why do capable people withdraw from the conventional employment market? its inflexible, inscrutible, unfair, demanding yet wasteful, dishonest, manipulative, political, abusive, and doesnt offer a compelling cost benefit. people take jobs that pay less when the job is more flexible, straightforward and honest.

video about hiring. makes some good points. agrees with the pma approach on several points. hire for a specific need. make an accurate job description. be explicit about the mission and compensation. use networks of people. use a trial period to work with them before committing. hire well or face a bozo explosion. he says to check references, but that is unnecessary if trial work is easy and you slowly escalate trust.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisISSGhVRM

modern wisdom interview with nicholas eberstadt about prime male labro force withdrawl. disagrees that there is a structural solution to labor force withdrawl, claims it is mental, emotional, spiritual, attitudinal because immigrants have high participation. i think that work has to be more satisfying than sitting on a couch high and playing video games. he does describe that the solution will, quote generate spontaneously and spread like a prairie fire. when people see something good, they want more of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vknKvG3yrYM this is the same argument that a direct to consumer product needs to be overwhelming compelling. if you meet that standard, your product can be very popular.

robin hanson talk take the gold https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCNgBazFnjU
the gold is that there are a lot of big organizations that make bad quality decisions. prediction markets, if applied to the important decisions of big organizations would improve the quality of their decisions, produce a huge amount of value, and the prediction market providers could capture some of it. thats why decision markets, not prediction markets, to focus on this modality. a decision market is where you estimate the consequence of a particular choice in a decision. in addition to big organizations, all of the social causes and policy issues that society is having trouble to solve, better decisions could help them to advance. decision markets are potentially very valuable. how do we deploy them? analogy with motors. after the motor was developed, you could easily demonstrate that it has power, but no one can adopt naked motors. the first application was pumping water out of mines. motors could be designed, sold, operated, maintained, successful and promoted in that specific application. considering decision markets, what is the largest, common, frequent, highest value decision that people get wrong? how about hiring, or company ceo hiring firing decision markets. dont offer a general decision market platform and tell the customer to figure out how to apply it, make a specialized service that is ready to apply and easy to use. innovation is a combination of a few elegant ideas and a lot of messy details. the initial versions in a narrow application work out the messy details. to get the gold, you need to have a specific application and work out the details. decision markets can make better decisions in existing businesses but executives do not want them. there is enormous value in making better decisions, decision markets make better decisions, decision markets are a working technology, the last remaining step is to develop and offer decision market products for specific applications that are effective and ready to use.  

people who argue that you have to break eggs to make an omelette have no intention to make an omelette, their intention is to break eggs. executives claim they manage the company to maximize shareholder value. if they wanted to maximize shareholder value, they would act totally different. the intention of executives is not to maximize shareholder value, the intention of executives is to manage, to be in charge, to increase their power, money, prestige.

in other words prediction markets are bets and betting is a tax on bullshit. people bullshit constantly, even at work, and it is impossible to refute the infinite stream of bullshit. instead of refuting the infinite stream of bullshit, you can challenge them, wanna bet? these words instantly engage a different mental process. people who dont know what they are talking about, or people who intentionally lie, will refuse to bet. people who are publicly committed to their lie will agree to bet but everyone who knows they are wrong has an incentive to bet against them to win their money. people who manage conventional companies are almost always bullshitters that dont want to bet, they do not want to participate in a prediction market, you cannot introduce prediction markets to existing companies.


effectiveness of public review https://x.com/CartersPeanuts/status/1826659543809753135

the existence of almost any meetings at all is a symptom. people can meet individually to solve a specific problem, but regular meetings or group meetings are almost always a negative. symposia, forums, social events can be productive, but they are not meetings in the sense of business. money talks and bullshit walks, what do you need a meeting for?

is it secure? is it immutable? is it decentralized? is a conversation secure, immutable or decentralized? this system helps people to organize themselves. software cant enforce physical security. we can eventually add features to resist cheating, lying and adversarial agents, but the initial version still has a lot of work to do to assist agents to coordinate in the common case of honest agents. agents can apply conventional security practices to improve physical security, resistance to tampering and lying. for example, secure backups with periodic database checkpoints held by a trusted party could serve as evidence against liars. multiple backups can decentralize. copying periodic database hashes could create an immutable, decentralized ledger.

write a story of how pma enters the economy and show how to use it, advertisement, entertainment, tutorial. post on an online community or an existing conference, have a few small events. a few people catch on, propose promote and conduct larger scale events. these are repeated and then expanded with variation until it becomes an ongoing concern. then you describe an explosion, mainstream detection, rejection, conflict, latency, turn to acceptance. social event with tasks for distributing hor derves, picking up trash, taking out trash, welcoming guests, introducing pma, inviting and vouching for other guests. what do meetups gatherings and parties need? drinks and snacks. have an event specific food service with open participation. what happens when the party is over? people need accomodation. you could do a capsule hotel. evidence devices that run a microphone and camera at key locations in the event space for evidence of tasks and policy viloations. the pop up city style.

no one can measure productivity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6QcLrN2HTc corporate jobs cannot measure productivity, corporate management relies on proxies, employees game the proxies to keep their paycheck, everyone is lying and playing a game.

one of the key objectives of the pma project is to make a practical way to measure productivity. we know exactly what work you did, how much your work cost, how much time you spent, how much your work consitutes the products and how many products are sold. we know your productivity potentially as well as a factory worker. the only difficult step is quantifying how much your work constitutes the value of the products. i think this can be approached with knockout and replication. if you remove one piece from the product, sometimes this improves the product, sometimes it has negligible effect, sometimes it slightly degrades the product, and sometimes it cripples the product. in every case except crippling, knockout can help you to measure the value of a feature or a piece of work. with crippling, you can try to replicate the missing part at different levels of quality or cost to estimate the difficulty of this part of the capability, and compare it to the other parts of the capability. the amount that the product is crippled puts an upper limiit on the value of the feature, and then the replications can help narrow it in.

the distinction between a founder owner and a manager. management is a dishonest profession. people create value at all parts of the organization. it might be helpful to meet up periodically to align the most productive participants to lead the organization. https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html

interview about metadao where they make the same arguments as pma and come to some of the same conclusions. their decision markets seem to me to be complex and ungrounded. https://x.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1834495689176265084
